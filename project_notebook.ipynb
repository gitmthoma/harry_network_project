    "### What is Network Analysis & Why Network Analysis with Harry Potter?\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of social network analysis, we want to understand it here as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Network analysis can be considered as a set of techniques with a common methodological perspective that allow researchers to represent the relationships between actors and to analyze the social structures that result from the recurrence of these relationships. The basic assumption is that a better explanation of social phenomena is achieved by analyzing the relationships between actors. This analysis is done by collecting relationship data organized in the form of a matrix. When actors are represented as nodes and their relationships are represented as lines between pairs of nodes, the concept of a social network is transformed from a metaphor to an operational analytical tool that uses the mathematical language of graph theory and the linear assumptions of matrix algebra. (Chiesi 2015, 518)\n",
    "\n",
    "The forText digital research environment defines network analysis in the context of literary analysis and visualization as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">In network analysis, certain entities (e.g., figures, authors, places) are previously examined in their relationship to each other as a network of nodes and connecting edges or relations. In this way, quantitative aspects of the relational system, primarily the number of nodes, edges, and links, first become clear and can serve as the basis for a qualitative analysis. (Schumacher 2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use natural language processing (NLP) and network analysis tools to **provide a representation of the social relationships of the main characters in the Harry Potter films**. Based on a database containing the dialog scripts of the eight films and various views created by queries, we first want to pre-select the characters (NER) and build up some plain text data. Then, based on the results of Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling, we want to map their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think that this approach could have **exemplary value for the analysis of more complex (fictional) social networks**. In particular, we can imagine that following such a basic consideration, especially the change of such relationships over time could be of interest for both film and literature or, for example, theatre studies. In this fields, for example, the comparison of certain patterns of relationships in certain periods, concerning certain authors, or certain genres might also be of interest.\n"
