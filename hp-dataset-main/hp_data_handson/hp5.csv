3495;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;Oh, it's you.
3496;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Gang thug;What should we do with him, Big D?
3497;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums.
3498;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;Shut up!
3499;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you?
3500;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;What?
3501;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Arabella Figg;You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents!
3502;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;"I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. ""No, don't kill Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!"""
3503;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you...
3504;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;Why should I?
3505;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
3506;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away.
3507;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;G-go home!
3508;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Gang thug;What?
3509;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;Get out of here!
3510;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
3511;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;Don't point that thing at me!
3512;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !
3513;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Dudley Dursley;What's happening?
3514;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Quiet!
3515;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Dudley! Run!
3516;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back.
3517;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Dudley, no!
3518;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Lumos!
3519;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;"""Expecto Patronum!'"
3520;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Voldemort;Bow to death, Harry...
3521;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Lily potter;Haaaaaaaarry!...
3522;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;"""Expecto Patronum! '"
3523;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Vernon Dursley;What the heii are those?
3524;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Dementors.
3525;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Petunia Dursley;What happened, Duddikins?
3526;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Vernon Dursley;What the hell is a dementoid?
3527;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Petunia Dursley;They didn't--?
3528;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;No.
3529;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Vernon Dursley;I want some answers!
3530;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;We were attacked.
3531;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Vernon Dursley;By those...things?
3532;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth.
3533;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Vernon Dursley;How do you know that?
3534;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Vernon Dursley;Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two?
3535;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
3536;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Vernon Dursley;Why is he all right then?
3537;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dudley Demented;Harry Potter;Because I used magic to save his
3538;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;Lumos!
3539;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Vernon Dursley;Who are all you lot?
3540;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Quiet, Dursley.
3541;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here.
3542;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;What are you doing here?
3543;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear.
3544;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;How'd he know? It just happened!
3545;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?
3546;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks.
3547;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?
3548;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-
3549;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;We're not talking about it here, it's too risky.
3550;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Blast it.
3551;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Nymphadora Tonks;Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting?
3552;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip.
3553;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;How are we getting there?
3554;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;Brooms.
3555;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Kingsley Shacklebolt;There's the first signal.
3556;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Right, let's go.
3557;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;On your broom, Harry.
3558;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy! The advanced guard surrounds Harry.
3559;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Nymphadora Tonks;Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye.
3560;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry.
3561;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;Uh, is that very likely?
3562;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Kingsley Shacklebolt;No one's going to die.
3563;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;There's the second signal!
3564;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go!
3565;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;The third signal, everyone. Let's
3566;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Stay in formation!
3567;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;We need more height!
3568;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Contacts to the south!
3569;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Kingsley Shacklebolt;Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down!
3570;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;There's the other one, Alastor!
3571;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;Expecto--!
3572;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;Harry, leave it to us!
3573;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;No!
3574;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;"""Expecto Patronum!'"
3575;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Remus Lupin;Get Harry to the safe house!
3576;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Come on, Potter! Keep moving!
3577;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Harry Potter;But I can help!
3578;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!
3579;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;We're not far, now!
3580;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Did you get rid of them?
3581;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Kingsley Shacklebolt;They're gone, Alastor.
3582;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Nymphadora Tonks;We're there!
3583;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Advance Guard;Alastor Moody;Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!
3584;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Remus Lupin;Stay here, Harry.
3585;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Kingsley Shacklebolt;Clear!
3586;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Alastor Moody;Right, Harry, this way.
3587;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Alastor Moody;Here, read this.
3588;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Alastor Moody;Come on, inside. Hurry.
3589;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Remus Lupin;Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything.
3590;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Walburga Black;Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?!
3591;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Sirius Black;Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet!
3592;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Walburga Black;Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!
3593;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Harry Potter;Was that your--?
3594;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Sirius Black;Mother, yes. Dear old mum.
3595;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Harry Potter;But...why here?
3596;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Molly Weasley;Hello, Harry dear.
3597;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Harry Potter;Mrs. Weasley!
3598;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Molly Weasley;Sirius, the meeting is about to start!
3599;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Sirius Black;Right.
3600;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place;Molly Weasley;Harry, dear, go on upstairs-— quietly, if you please. They're all up there.
3601;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;Harry!
3602;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;Let him breathe, Hermione!
3603;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!
3604;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;Good to see you, mate.
3605;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;Come on, inside.
3606;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to.
3607;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence.
3608;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;Right.
3609;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;He thought you would be safest there.
3610;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...
3611;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;So, why's he keeping me in the dark?
3612;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;Didn't you bother asking?
3613;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy.
3614;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
3615;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings.
3616;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;You've still been here!
3617;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;What's been going on?
3618;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things.
3619;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy.
3620;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;What's this Order everyone's talking about?
3621;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.
3622;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;You can come down now, the meeting's over.
3623;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;Arthur-
3624;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;Well, the Ministry is furious with you.
3625;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;Why?
3626;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;You'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow.
3627;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;Okay.
3628;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
3629;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort.
3630;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything.
3631;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--
3632;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;He has a right to know, Molly.
3633;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;It's not your decision!
3634;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something.
3635;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;He's not a child, Molly.
3636;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;He's not an adult either!
3637;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
3638;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;He's not your son.
3639;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;Who else does he have, then?
3640;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;He's got me. He's like a son to me.
3641;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;What do you want to know, Harry?
3642;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
3643;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change.
3644;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;How?
3645;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore.
3646;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;And what's his plan?
3647;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;He's building up his army again, just like before.
3648;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
3649;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Remus Lupin;We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult.
3650;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back.
3651;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;But...why?
3652;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Remus Lupin;Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked.
3653;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;But you're telling people, right?
3654;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry...
3655;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Remus Lupin;But Dumbledore is doing all he can.
3656;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Arthur Weasley;If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--
3657;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;What?
3658;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Sirius Black;You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A weapon.
3659;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;What kind of weapon?
3660;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Remus Lupin;I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more.
3661;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?
3662;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;No, my scar kept hurting.
3663;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;Yeah...nerves...
3664;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Molly Weasley;Good luck, Harry!
3665;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending
3666;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Harry Potter;Thanks, Hermione.
3667;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;What does he get a hug for?
3668;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;Oh, sure, that's why.
3669;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Ron Weasley;Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...
3670;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Order of the Phoenix;Hermione Granger;Would you like a hug?
3671;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Well, come on, Harry. Time to go.
3672;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Harry Potter;Bye.
3673;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Good, good, not very many Muggles.
3674;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Well, come on Harry, in we go.
3675;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again...
3676;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Witch;Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business.
3677;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing.
3678;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Witch;Pleas stand by.
3679;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Keep close, Harry!
3680;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Ah, Perkins, good morn-
3681;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Perkins;Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing.
3682;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that.
3683;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Perkins;It started at eight!
3684;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!
3685;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Witch;Department of Mysteries.
3686;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Harry Potter;Department of Mysteries?
3687;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret.
3688;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Come on, Harry!
3689;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Harry Potter;I've been there before...
3690;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely...
3691;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Ministry of Magic;Arthur Weasley;There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck...
3692;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;You're late.
3693;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Harry Potter;Er...sorry.
3694;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;No matter, the accused will take his seat.
3695;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Very well, we are ready to begin.
3696;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Albus Dumbledore;Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
3697;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you?
3698;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Well. The...ah...charges.
3699;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle.
3700;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Harry Potter;Yes.
3701;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Harry Potter;Yes, but-
3702;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Within full sight of a Muggle?
3703;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Harry Potter;Yes, but-
3704;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Susan Bones;You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly- defined shape?
3705;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Harry Potter;Yes.
3706;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Susan Bones;That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter.
3707;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;It doesn't matter how impressive it was!
3708;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Harry Potter;But I did it because of the Dementors!
3709;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Susan Bones;What do you mean?
3710;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Harry Potter;My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away.
3711;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story.
3712;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Susan Bones;Dementors in Little Whinging?
3713;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying.
3714;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;We haven't got time to-
3715;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness.
3716;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Full name?
3717;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Arabella Figg;Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging.
3718;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;So...what is your story?
3719;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Arabella Figg;I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys.
3720;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Susan Bones;What did the Dementors look like?
3721;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Arabella Figg;Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks.
3722;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Susan Bones;Anything else?
3723;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Arabella Figg;I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again.
3724;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Very well, you may go.
3725;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Not very convincing.
3726;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Susan Bones;Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely.
3727;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not...
3728;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Albus Dumbledore;Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius.
3729;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore.
3730;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Dolores Umbridge;Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic of ordering an attack on this boy?
3731;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Dementors are irrelevant!
3732;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Well, yes, if he's telling the truth!
3733;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges?
3734;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Cornelius Fudge;All opposed?
3735;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hearing;Albus Dumbledore;Excellent.
3736;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Arthur Weasley;Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful!
3737;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Arthur Weasley;You were tried by the full court?
3738;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;I think so, yeah.
3739;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;Er...is Percy mad at you?
3740;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Arthur Weasley;Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left.
3741;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Lucius Malfoy;Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter.
3742;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;What are you doing here?
3743;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Lucius Malfoy;Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours.
3744;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Lucius Malfoy;Shall we continue this in your
3745;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Cornelius Fudge;Certainly.
3746;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?
3747;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Arthur Weasley;Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension.
3748;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Arthur Weasley;Settle down, you three!
3749;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Arthur Weasley;Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?
3750;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;Yeah, absolutely.
3751;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Arthur Weasley;Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with.
3752;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Fred Weasley;George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet.
3753;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;George Weasley;Right you are, Fred.
3754;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Arthur Weasley;Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late.
3755;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;Harry!
3756;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;You all right, Harry?
3757;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
3758;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;Harry, I've got something that might interest you.
3759;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were cleaning.
3760;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle
3761;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;My parents.
3762;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;I miss them, Sirius...
3763;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too.
3764;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you didn't...
3765;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?
3766;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it...
3767;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;Thanks.
3768;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;Kreacher, get out of here! Now!
3769;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Kreacher;Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house...
3770;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Harry Potter;Who..who was that?
3771;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Originals;Sirius Black;Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny.
3772;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Hermione Granger;Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter.
3773;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Hermione Granger;What about you, Harry?
3774;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Hermione Granger;Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!
3775;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;I'm sure. Nothing.
3776;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;So...congratulations Ron, Hermione...
3777;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Ron Weasley;Come on, lets go back downstairs!
3778;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.
3779;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;What is that?
3780;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;Yes it is, it's right there!
3781;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Luna Lovegood;I see them too, Harry.
3782;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;Er...you are?
3783;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Luna Lovegood;Luna. Luna Lovegood.
3784;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;Well, thanks Luna.
3785;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
3786;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Hermione Granger;I hope he's all right...
3787;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Ron Weasley;What if he were still on his...
3788;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Ron Weasley;What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
3789;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Luna Lovegood;Harry Potter;Yeah, could be.
3790;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Albus Dumbledore;I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley...
3791;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Albus Dumbledore;... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door.
3792;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Albus Dumbledore;Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave.
3793;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Albus Dumbledore;Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-—
3794;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Dolores Umbridge;Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school?
3795;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Dolores Umbridge;Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position.
3796;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Dean Thomas;So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus?
3797;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Harry Potter;What?
3798;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Seamus Finnigan;Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts...
3799;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Harry Potter;Why?
3800;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Seamus Finnigan;Well...because of you...
3801;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Harry Potter;What did I do?
3802;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Seamus Finnigan;She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who and Dumbledore's a right nutter...
3803;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Harry Potter;Where'd she get that from?
3804;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Harry Potter;No one believes me, Hedwig. No one...
3805;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Preserve, Perfect and Prune;Harry Potter;I'm alone...
3806;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;Sorry, Professor...
3807;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late.
3808;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it?
3809;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;I will be following a pre-approved Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan.
3810;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Copy this down.
3811;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Yes?
3812;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Hermione Granger;I wanted to know something about your course aims.
3813;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Well, they should be perfectly self- evident.
3814;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Hermione Granger;But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?
3815;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you a Ministry Expert?
3816;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Hermione Granger;No, but-
3817;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment-
3818;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Hermione Granger;But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?
3819;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;What good's theory in the real world?
3820;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;What about Lord Voldemort?
3821;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight.
3822;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie.
3823;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
3824;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!
3825;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?
3826;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;The boy's death was a tragic accident.
3827;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
3828;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!
3829;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;Yeah, talk to somebody who cares.
3830;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Dolores Umbridge;That goes to Professor McGonagall, dear.
3831;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;Yeah. But she called me a liar!
3832;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;Yes, Professor.
3833;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Minerva McGonagall;Good. Off you go.
3834;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Hermione Granger;How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!
3835;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Ron Weasley;You reckon she's here to spy on us?
3836;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Hermione Granger;Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order.
3837;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;Oh! Sorry...
3838;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Angelina Johnson;Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there.
3839;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;I'll never get out of it, Angelina.
3840;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Angelina Johnson;Well, just...don't do it again!
3841;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Ron Weasley;Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?
3842;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;Later, I've got detention.
3843;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Hermione Granger;Good luck, Harry.
3844;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Professor Umbridge's Class;Harry Potter;Thanks.
3845;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Dolores Umbridge;Ah, Potter. Sit down.
3846;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Dolores Umbridge;You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill.
3847;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Dolores Umbridge;"You will write ""I will not tell lies"" until I tell you to stop. Understand?"
3848;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;There's no ink.
3849;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Dolores Umbridge;Oh...you won't need ink.
3850;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Dolores Umbridge;Problem, Potter?
3851;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Dolores Umbridge;That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper.
3852;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;Hey, Harry.
3853;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.
3854;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;No, I haven't.
3855;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something.
3856;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Dolores Umbridge;That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand.
3857;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Ron Weasley;Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!
3858;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Ron Weasley;Harry--bloody hell!
3859;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.
3860;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Ron Weasley;You said she was making you do lines!
3861;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.
3862;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;That old hag! She's sick!
3863;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;No, I'm telling anyone.
3864;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;Harry, I really think you should tell--
3865;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;No!
3866;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help.
3867;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.
3868;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;I've asked Sirius about it.
3869;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe.
3870;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention.
3871;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Ron Weasley;Always knew she was a bit fishy.
3872;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;You think she's working for You- Know-Who?
3873;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?
3874;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Hermione Granger;I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know.
3875;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Detention With Dolores;Harry Potter;Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry.
3876;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Sybill Trelawney;Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond!
3877;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Sybill Trelawney;Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide.
3878;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Dolores Umbridge;And how long have you been at this post?
3879;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Dolores Umbridge;I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney?
3880;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Sybill Trelawney;I am.
3881;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Dolores Umbridge;And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight?
3882;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Sybill Trelawney;These things tend to skip...several...generations.
3883;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Dolores Umbridge;Of course.
3884;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Dolores Umbridge;Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me?
3885;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Dolores Umbridge;The Inner Eye does not See upon command!
3886;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Sybill Trelawney;My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please!
3887;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Sybill Trelawney;My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends!
3888;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Sybill Trelawney;Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death?
3889;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Harry Potter;Er...
3890;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Sybill Trelawney;Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others.
3891;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Hogwarts High Inquisitor;Dolores Umbridge;Well, if that's the best you can do, Professor, I will be going.
3892;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Where are we going, Hermione?
3893;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;There we are.
3894;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ron Weasley;"""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?"
3895;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Come on, I'll explain in a minute.
3896;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Hermione, what's going on?
3897;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with.
3898;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;You mean about us teaching ourselves?
3899;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Neville Longbottom;Hey, Harry.
3900;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Hey, Neville.
3901;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Uh...same to you, Luna.
3902;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Fred Weasley;Hear, hear!
3903;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name.
3904;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;That's the first time you've said his name.
3905;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Zacharias Smith;How do we know You-Know-Who's really back?
3906;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;George Weasley;Dumbledore believes he is.
3907;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Justin Finch-Fletchley;You mean Dumbledore believes him.
3908;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--
3909;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;It's okay, Hermione.
3910;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
3911;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher.
3912;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Neville Longbottom;But we're all students. None of us has the experience to--
3913;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ginny Weasley;Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
3914;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Me?
3915;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Michael Corner;I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't.
3916;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Susan Bones;One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office.
3917;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Uh...well, yeah, I did.
3918;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Lee Jordan;Blimey, Harry...
3919;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Lavander Brown;Wow...
3920;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Fred Weasley;Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year.
3921;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Cho Chang;And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament!
3922;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ron Weasley;Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
3923;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ginny Weasley;And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer.
3924;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?
3925;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Where are we going to meet?
3926;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Neville Longbottom;What about an unused classroom?
3927;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;That might work. I'll look into that.
3928;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Ok, good.
3929;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here.
3930;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ernest Macmillan;I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing...
3931;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted.
3932;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Also, what should we call ourselves?
3933;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Angelina Johnson;What about the Anti-Unbridhe League?
3934;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ginny Weasley;I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
3935;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;We'll let you know when we're going
3936;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;I think that went well.
3937;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Yeah.
3938;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;And did you see Cho, Harry?
3939;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?!
3940;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Angelina Johnson;Harry, you won't believe...that Umbridge woman...this is too much!!
3941;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;What's she done now?
3942;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Angelina Johnson;Follow me.
3943;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;"""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
3944;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Angelina Johnson;She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to Dumbledore to get her to allow it.
3945;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Not only that, but what about the
3946;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;This isn't a coincidence.
3947;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;She knows.
3948;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ron Weasley;She can't!
3949;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her.
3950;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ron Weasley;Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.
3951;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing.
3952;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;What would we do without you, Hermione?
3953;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Hedwig!
3954;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;She's hurt!
3955;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Ron Weasley;She doesn't look very good.
3956;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Hermione Granger;Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do.
3957;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Minerva McGonagall;Potter!
3958;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Minerva McGonagall;Where on earth are you going at this time of night?
3959;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.
3960;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Minerva McGonagall;What?
3961;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Minerva McGonagall;Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry.
3962;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;London.
3963;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Minerva McGonagall;Well, give her to me. I'll run her
3964;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Minerva McGonagall;There you are.
3965;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Minerva McGonagall;Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?
3966;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Harry Potter;Yes, Professor.
3967;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;In the Hog's Head;Minerva McGonagall;Good. Now, off to bed.
3968;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dobby;Mr. Harry Potter!
3969;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;Dobby! What are you doing here?
3970;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dobby;Dobby is cleaning, sir.
3971;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;What is it, Dobby.
3972;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dobby;Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep.
3973;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me.
3974;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby.
3975;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.
3976;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dobby;Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter.
3977;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;That's brilliant, Dobby!
3978;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dobby;Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter.
3979;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays.
3980;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Lee Jordan;...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle!
3981;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Students;Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King!
3982;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;Just ignore them, Ron!
3983;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Draco Malfoy;I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!
3984;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Hermione Granger;Harry, are you all right?
3985;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Draco Malfoy;Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?
3986;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Draco Malfoy;I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother!
3987;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Draco Malfoy;And his pathetic loser of a father too!
3988;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Draco Malfoy;But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!
3989;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Rolanda Hooch;Impedimenta!
3990;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Rolanda Hooch;Don't make me stupify you, Potter!
3991;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Minerva McGonagall;My office. Now.
3992;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Minerva McGonagall;In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display.
3993;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;Malfoy provoked us.
3994;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Minerva McGonagall;Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost!
3995;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Minerva McGonagall;I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now.
3996;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Minerva McGonagall;What is it, Dolores?
3997;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dolores Umbridge;I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two.
3998;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Minerva McGonagall;You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office.
3999;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Minerva McGonagall;Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions.
4000;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dolores Umbridge;I hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this.
4001;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dolores Umbridge;Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff.
4002;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dolores Umbridge;So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this one's twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as well.
4003;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;Ban us...for life.
4004;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dolores Umbridge;Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter.
4005;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dolores Umbridge;Ah, I'll take your brooms as well.
4006;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Dolores Umbridge;Well, have a wonderful day.
4007;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;You've--!
4008;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Minerva McGonagall;My hands are tied, Potter.
4009;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Angelina Johnson;I can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day...
4010;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Ron Weasley;I'm going to resign.
4011;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;You can't!
4012;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Ron Weasley;I'm horrible! I should never have joined.
4013;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Harry Potter;If you quit, we'll be out four players!
4014;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Ron Weasley;This is the worst day of my life.
4015;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Hermione Granger;I know something that could cheer you up.
4016;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Dumbledore's Army;Hermione Granger;Hagrid's back!
4017;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Hagrid, what happened to you?
4018;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Rubeus Hagrid;I've fine, I tell yeh!
4019;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Ron Weasley;Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!
4020;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Rubeus Hagrid;Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order.
4021;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year.
4022;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp.
4023;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Ron Weasley;A month?
4024;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Rubeus Hagrid;O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em.
4025;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;So what did you do when you found them?
4026;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Ron Weasley;So...no giants are coming?
4027;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Rubeus Hagrid;Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes.
4028;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
4029;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Neville Longbottom;Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?
4030;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
4031;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Zacharias Smith;Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year.
4032;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Ron Weasley;Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
4033;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life.
4034;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go.
4035;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Neville Longbottom;Expelliarmus!
4036;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Well done, Neville!
4037;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one.
4038;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Neville Longbottom;Expelliarmus!
4039;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Neville Longbottom;I did it! I did it!
4040;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day.
4041;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Hagrid's Tale;Harry Potter;Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!
4042;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Neville Longbottom;What's wrong with him?
4043;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Ron Weasley;Get McGonagall! Go!
4044;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Ron Weasley;Harry! HARRY!
4045;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Minerva McGonagall;Potter!
4046;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Minerva McGonagall;Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please...
4047;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
4048;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Minerva McGonagall;You dreamed this, Potter?
4049;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;No, I saw it happen! I...I was there...
4050;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Minerva McGonagall;You're sure this happened, Potter?
4051;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Minerva McGonagall;We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter.
4052;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Professor McGonagall, and...ah...
4053;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;What can I do for you?
4054;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Minerva McGonagall;Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare...
4055;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?
4056;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective.
4057;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Is Arthur seriously injured?
4058;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;Yes!
4059;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;You were listening?
4060;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Everard;Naturally.
4061;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people.
4062;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them.
4063;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Fawkes, we will need a warning.
4064;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Naturally, naturally.
4065;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;What news?
4066;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Everard;I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He doesn't look good. Covered in blood...
4067;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Dilys Derwent;Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad.
4068;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Good.
4069;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken.
4070;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Phineas.
4071;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Albus Dumbledore;Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while.
4072;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Phineas;It's late, Dumbledore...
4073;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Phineas;I'm going, I'm going...
4074;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;Sit, Potter.
4075;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency.
4076;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;What's that, Professor?
4077;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
4078;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;Voldemort can read minds?
4079;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter.
4080;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered.
4081;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;So he could read our minds right now?
4082;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?
4083;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions.
4084;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;Wand out, Potter.
4085;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.
4086;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;What are you going to do?
4087;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;I am going to break into your mind.
4088;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;No!
4089;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind.
4090;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon
4091;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Arthur Weasley;Come on, Harry!
4092;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;I've been there before...
4093;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;What was that?
4094;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;I've just realized...
4095;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;Realized what, Potter?
4096;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?
4097;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;What did you say?
4098;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Harry Potter;That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it.
4099;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Occlumency;Severus Snape;There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you.
4100;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;I can do whatever I wish!
4101;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Sybill Trelawney;This is my home!
4102;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;Not anymore.
4103;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;Now remove yourself from this castle!
4104;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;I have the authority, Headmaster!
4105;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However...
4106;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;-..-You cannot send them from this
4107;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher.
4108;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor
4109;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough.
4110;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;This is Firenze.
4111;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Ron Weasley;So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?
4112;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Harry Potter;It's got to be.
4113;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Hermione Granger;That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.
4114;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Harry Potter;Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!
4115;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Ron Weasley;But why the Department of Mysteries?
4116;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Hermione Granger;It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret.
4117;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Hermione Granger;Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban.
4118;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Ron Weasley;Bloody hell!
4119;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Harry Potter;They're all Death Eaters!
4120;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Hermione Granger;Yes.
4121;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Harry Potter;Voldemort.
4122;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group--
4123;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;I'm not sure that's true, Professor.
4124;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;I'm sorry?
4125;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal.
4126;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced.
4127;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?
4128;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;I have a witness right here!
4129;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight.
4130;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;Let's ask her, shall we?
4131;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;You can shake your head for an
4132;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;What do you mean by shaking your head, girl?
4133;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;But what about Potter? He was the
4134;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;Why are you shaking your head, girl?
4135;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge.
4136;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself.
4137;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;Well, what about the meeting tonight?
4138;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing.
4139;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Well, Minister. You've caught me.
4140;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your army!
4141;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Quite correct, Cornelius.
4142;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time!
4143;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;This is too good to be true!
4144;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Harry Potter;Professor, no!
4145;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Quiet, Harry!
4146;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry--
4147;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag.
4148;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;I see no snag, Dumbledore.
4149;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would 'come quietly.'
4150;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore?
4151;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore?
4152;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you.
4153;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Are you all right?
4154;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Minerva McGonagall;Yes, we're fine.
4155;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts.
4156;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Harry Potter;I'm so sorry, Professor!
4157;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you.
4158;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring.
4159;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Albus Dumbledore;Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk.
4160;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Cornelius Fudge;Find him!
4161;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;"""By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
4162;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school.
4163;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Unquiet Escape;Dolores Umbridge;Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.' I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't.
4164;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Harry Potter;Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
4165;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Ron Weasley;No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad.
4166;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Hermione Granger;Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.
4167;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Its jus' up ahead, here.
4168;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Harry Potter;Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?
4169;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney.
4170;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Hermione Granger;We won't let her!
4171;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Hermione Granger;Of course we'll help.
4172;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Knew yeh'd say yes!
4173;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Okay, real quiet like from here on.
4174;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;There we are!
4175;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Hermione Granger;Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!
4176;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn' leave 'im!
4177;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Hermione Granger;Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?
4178;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;He's me brother!
4179;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died.
4180;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp!
4181;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Yeh all righ', Grawp?
4182;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy.
4183;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Grawp;Hermy!
4184;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Bad Grawpy! Bad boy!
4185;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;We don' attack our friends, Grawpy!
4186;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;See, he don' know any better.
4187;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'ima bit o' company.
4188;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh blimey...
4189;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Bane;I thought we told you that you were no longer welcome in this place, Hagrid. You or that beast you brought from afar.
4190;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;S'not up to you who comes and goes in this forest.
4191;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Bane;You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the servant of the humans at
4192;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean!
4193;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Rubeus Hagrid;Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here!
4194;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Grawp;Bane;We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you. But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit.
4195;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;Have you been practicing, Potter?
4196;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Harry Potter;Yeah.
4197;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;Well, we shall see, won't we?
4198;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Sirius Black;Put that away, James.
4199;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Sirius Black;I'm bored. Wish it was full moon.
4200;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Remus Lupin;Easy for you to say.
4201;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. Sirius grins.
4202;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;All right, there, Snivellus?
4203;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Sirius Black;Expelliarmus!
4204;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;Impedimenta!
4205;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;You just wait...
4206;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;And now, the moment you've all been waiting for--
4207;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Lily Potter;Leave him alone, James Potter!
4208;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;Another charity case, Lily?
4209;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Lily Potter;What has he done to you?
4210;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;Nothing. It's more the fact that he exists, you see...
4211;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;Semper-——
4212;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;Levicorpus!
4213;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Lily Potter;Leave him alone, Potter!
4214;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;I will if you go out with me.
4215;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Lily Potter;I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down.
4216;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Sirius Black;Locomotor mortis!
4217;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Lily Potter;I said, leave him alone!
4218;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;Don't make me hex you, Lily.
4219;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Lily Potter;Then let him go!
4220;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;Fine!
4221;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus!
4222;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
4223;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;Apologize to her! Now!
4224;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Lily Potter;Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is!
4225;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;I would never call you that.
4226;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Lily Potter;You make me sick, Potter.
4227;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;James Potter;Lily! Hey Lily!
4228;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;Having fun, Potter?
4229;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;Been enjoying yourself?
4230;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Harry Potter;No!
4231;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;Amusing man, your father...
4232;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Harry Potter;I--sorry!
4233;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;You will repeat what you saw to no
4234;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Harry Potter;No, of course not!
4235;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!
4236;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Snape's Worst Memory;Severus Snape;Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again!
4237;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Voldemort;Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?
4238;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Sirius Black;I would rather die!
4239;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Voldemort;Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then.
4240;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Voldemort;I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh.
4241;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Griselda Marchbanks;Are you all right, Potter?
4242;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Griselda Marchbanks;Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe you'll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but--—
4243;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;No--no, I've done all I can.
4244;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Ron Weasley;You all right?
4245;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!
4246;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;How do you know?
4247;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;I just saw it.
4248;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;How're we going to get there?
4249;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Ron Weasley;To the Department of Mysteries?
4250;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;We've got to do something!
4251;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world...
4252;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Ron Weasley;Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
4253;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;It just seems so unlikely, Harry!
4254;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;I won't let Sirius die!
4255;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Ginny Weasley;We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
4256;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
4257;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius.
4258;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!
4259;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Ginny Weasley;Anything we can do to help?
4260;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;No, there isn't!
4261;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;Yes, they can, Harry.
4262;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;How?
4263;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office.
4264;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;Might be able to.
4265;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;Just give us a few seconds.
4266;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;Mind you, it's got to be really good!
4267;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;It's been too quiet around here
4268;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;Time we did some real damage to this place.
4269;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.
4270;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Ginny Weasley;We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.
4271;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
4272;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;That's all we'll need.
4273;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours.
4274;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while.
4275;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Hermione Granger;Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry.
4276;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Argus Filch;Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the Astronomy Tower!
4277;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Dolores Umbridge;Ready to try out the old punishments again?
4278;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;Grimmauld Place!
4279;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;That was worth it!
4280;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Argus Filch;I've got you now!
4281;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;Thank you for playing, one and all.
4282;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;And now, we've got to go!
4283;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
4284;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Kreacher;What's this? The Potter boy in the fire...
4285;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;Kreacher, where's Sirius?
4286;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Kreacher;Master went out.
4287;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Dolores Umbridge;So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it?
4288;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;Fairly amusing, yeah.
4289;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Dolores Umbridge;Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.
4290;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!
4291;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Dolores Umbridge;Well, now you're going to get your
4292;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;You know, I don't think we are.
4293;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree?
4294;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;Completely, Fred.
4295;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;Time to enter the real world?
4296;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;Definitely.
4297;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;Accio brooms!
4298;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;Accio brooms!
4299;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;We won't be seeing you.
4300;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;George Weasley;Yeah, don't bother writing.
4301;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Fred Weasley;Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
4302;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Harry Potter;You know where he is, don't you?
4303;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Kreacher;Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes.
4304;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Out of the Fire;Kreacher;Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries!
4305;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy!
4306;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Accio wand!
4307;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Who were you trying to contact?
4308;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;It's none of your business.
4309;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please?
4310;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you.
4311;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Severus Snape;You wished to see me?
4312;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum.
4313;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Severus Snape;Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none.
4314;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
4315;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Severus Snape;Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps from the office. Umbridge is enraged.
4316;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;We've played nicely, Potter. You
4317;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to your house had finished you off!
4318;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;You sent the Dementors?
4319;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Of course I did! Someone had to act!
4320;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;No! Please, stop!
4321;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Well, well.
4322;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;Hermione, no!
4323;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;We have to tell her, Harry...
4324;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;I would rather die!
4325;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?
4326;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...
4327;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Tell him?
4328;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;That it's ready. The weapon.
4329;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;You and Mr. Potter will take me to it.
4330;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Much further, is it?
4331;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;Oh, yes. It's very well hidden.
4332;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Magorian;What are you doing in our forest?
4333;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic!
4334;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Stay back, you beasts!
4335;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed--
4336;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;Don't call them that!
4337;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Magorian;You dare to insult us?
4338;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Come no closer!
4339;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Incarcerus!
4340;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Dolores Umbridge;Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods!
4341;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Centaur;What of these two?
4342;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Centaur;They have been here with Hagrid. They have heard the warnings and disobeyed. They must suffer the consequences!
4343;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Draco Malfoy;God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long.
4344;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Ron Weasley;Shut up, Malfoy!
4345;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Draco Malfoy;That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods!
4346;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Draco Malfoy;You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets.
4347;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Ron Weasley;Stupify!
4348;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Neville Longbottom;Expelliarmus!
4349;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Grawp;Haggar!
4350;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Grawp;Hermy! Where Haggar?
4351;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;Grawp, help us!
4352;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Grawp;Grawp save Hermy!
4353;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;Great plan, Hermione.
4354;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;I thought it worked out rather nicely.
4355;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Ron Weasley;That's just what we were wondering.
4356;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Ron Weasley;So, how do we get to the Ministry?
4357;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;I'd imagine we should fly.
4358;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;We've got no brooms.
4359;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Luna Lovegood;There are other ways to fly.
4360;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Luna Lovegood;I mean, they can fly, and they're
4361;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;What are those?
4362;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Ron Weasley;What are what?
4363;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Hermione Granger;There's nothing there, Harry.
4364;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Luna Lovegood;Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen someone die.
4365;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Neville Longbottom;I can see them too.
4366;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Harry Potter;All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off.
4367;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Ron Weasley;And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them.
4368;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Luna Lovegood;I'll show you.
4369;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Fight and Flight;Ron Weasley;Never again...
4370;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Ginny Weasley;What now, Harry?
4371;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;All right, come on.
4372;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Witch;Department of Mysteries.
4373;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Where is everyone?
4374;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Ginny Weasley;The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home.
4375;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
4376;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;This is it. Come on.
4377;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Stay close.
4378;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Ginny Weasley;Now where?
4379;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;I don't understand. In my dream,
4380;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;Well, let's try a few.
4381;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it.
4382;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Who's there?
4383;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Sirius?
4384;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room.
4385;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Does anyone else hear that?
4386;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Luna Lovegood;I do. It's coming from the Veil.
4387;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Luna Lovegood;There are people in there!
4388;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Ron Weasley;What do you mean, people?
4389;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;Harry, I think we should leave.
4390;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Sirius...yeah...
4391;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Alohomora!
4392;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it.
4393;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;This is it! Come on!
4394;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;This is it. This is where Sirius is!
4395;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;He's in here somewhere.
4396;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;I don't think Sirius is here.
4397;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Ron Weasley;Harry, have you seen this?
4398;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Ron Weasley;Er...it's got your name on it.
4399;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;What's my name doing here?
4400;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;Don't touch it, Harry!
4401;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Why not?
4402;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;Yeah, Harry, don't.
4403;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;It's got my name on it!
4404;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter.
4405;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Where's Sirius?
4406;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned.
4407;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here.
4408;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;Now give me that prophesy.
4409;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;What prophesy?
4410;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you.
4411;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Go ahead.
4412;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?
4413;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Come and find out!
4414;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here.
4415;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this!
4416;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;No! If the prophesy is smashed--
4417;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we torture her.
4418;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
4419;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?
4420;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;Surely you jest, Potter?
4421;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
4422;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?
4423;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half—-blood mouth!
4424;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?
4425;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;Control yourself, Bellatrix!
4426;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;What's so special about this
4427;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here?
4428;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;What?
4429;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;So that's what took you so long. We wondered.
4430;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself.
4431;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?
4432;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Now!
4433;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;Stupify!
4434;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;Stop them!
4435;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;Colloportus!
4436;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Where'd the rest go?
4437;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;Harry, they went the wrong way!
4438;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Death Eater;They might have gone on to the hall.
4439;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;Check under the desks.
4440;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Stupify!
4441;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;Avada-—
4442;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;Expelliarmus!
4443;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Stupify!
4444;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Ron!
4445;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Death Eater;Impedimenta!
4446;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Death Eater;We've got him!
4447;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Hermione Granger;Silenco! Stupify!
4448;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Pretificus Totalus!
4449;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;Stupify!
4450;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Hermione!
4451;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her.
4452;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;What's they do to her?
4453;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse.
4454;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Can we carry her?
4455;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;I'll do it. You're better at fighting.
4456;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;Where do we go?
4457;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;I don't know...
4458;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;What happened.
4459;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Ginny Weasley;I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell...
4460;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Ron Weasley;Hiyya, Harry.
4461;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Luna Lovegood;They hit her with something too.
4462;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?
4463;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;There they are!
4464;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over.
4465;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Let my friends go and I will.
4466;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Lucius Malfoy;You are not in a position to negotiate.
4467;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;Don't do it, Harry! Don't!
4468;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Stop, Neville!
4469;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;Neville? Neville Longbottom?
4470;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such a time!
4471;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;You put them in St. Mungos!
4472;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents.
4473;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;Don't give it to them!
4474;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Bellatrix Lestrange;Crucio!
4475;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Harry Potter;Are you all right?
4476;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Neville Longbottom;Yeah...
4477;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Department of Mysteries;Death Eater;Give me the prophesy!
4478;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Sirius Black;Get out of here, you two!
4479;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Sirius Black;That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries.
4480;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Harry Potter;You come with us!
4481;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Sirius Black;You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order.
4482;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Sirius Black;I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!
4483;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Sirius Black;Hello, cousin!
4484;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Lucius Malfoy;Potter!
4485;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Lucius Malfoy;We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord!
4486;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Lucius Malfoy;Stupify!
4487;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Harry Potter;Protego!
4488;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Neville Longbottom;It's Dumbledore!
4489;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Sirius Black;Is that the best you've got, cousin?
4490;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Remus Lupin;Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do...
4491;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Harry Potter;No...no...no....
4492;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Beyond the Veil;Remus Lupin;Harry, no!
4493;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Bellatrix Lestrange;You can't stop me, Potter!
4494;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Harry Potter;I'LL KILL you!!
4495;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Harry Potter;Stupify!
4496;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Bellatrix Lestrange;Come out, come out, Potter...
4497;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Bellatrix Lestrange;Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather?
4498;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Harry Potter;Crucio!
4499;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Bellatrix Lestrange;Crucio!
4500;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Bellatrix Lestrange;Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul...
4501;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Bellatrix Lestrange;Give me the prophesy!
4502;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Harry Potter;Can't. It got smashed by accident!
4503;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Bellatrix Lestrange;You lie!
4504;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Harry Potter;How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?
4505;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Bellatrix Lestrange;Forgive me, Master! I tried, I--
4506;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Harry Potter;He can't hear you from here, you know!
4507;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Voldemort;So, you smashed my prophesy...
4508;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Voldemort;I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter!
4509;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Side by Side;Voldemort;Avada Kadavra!
4510;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;You should not have come here tonight, Tom.
4511;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Voldemort;It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!
4512;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Voldemort;Avada Kedavra!
4513;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Voldemort;You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?
4514;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom.
4515;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Voldemort;There is nothing worse than death!
4516;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been.
4517;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Harry Potter;Look out!
4518;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Harry Potter;Professor!
4519;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;Stay where you are, Harry!
4520;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;Harry!
4521;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;Are you all right, Harry?
4522;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Percy Weasley;Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!
4523;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Cornelius Fudge;I know...I saw him too...
4524;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended.
4525;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Cornelius Fudge;Seize him!
4526;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!
4527;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be.
4528;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Cornelius Fudge;Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?
4529;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school.
4530;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Cornelius Fudge;What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?
4531;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school.
4532;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work.
4533;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head.
4534;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;Portus.
4535;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Cornelius Fudge;Dumbledore, I want some answers!
4536;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;The Second War has begun, Minister.
4537;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;Wizards Duel;Albus Dumbledore;Thank you...
4538;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Please sit, Harry.
4539;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;I understand how you feel, Harry--
4540;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;No you don't!
4541;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry.
4542;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength...
4543;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
4544;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;What can't I know?
4545;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;This pain is part of being human, Harry...
4546;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I don't care! I don't care!
4547;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
4548;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Let me out.
4549;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;No.
4550;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;You can't keep me in here!
4551;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it.
4552;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
4553;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man.
4554;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I already know all this.
4555;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?
4556;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Well, yeah, I did...
4557;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency.
4558;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
4559;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed.
4560;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-
4561;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year.
4562;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
4563;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed.
4564;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries.
4565;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection.
4566;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams.
4567;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius.
4568;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--
4569;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.
4570;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Why?
4571;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.
4572;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;What?
4573;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?
4574;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.
4575;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.
4576;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
4577;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated.
4578;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Sirius hated him.
4579;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.
4580;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!
4581;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;I was trying to save his life!
4582;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.
4583;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.
4584;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;She never loved me.
4585;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected.
4586;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.
4587;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?
4588;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Do you remember what you asked me that night?
4589;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
4590;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must.
4591;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I don't understand, Professor.
4592;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Professor, why am I so important to
4593;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy.
4594;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Sir, it got smashed.
4595;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.
4596;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Sybill Trelawney;"""The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to"
4597;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I'm not sure I understand all that, sir...
4598;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;And...it means me?
4599;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom.
4600;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;So it's not necessarily me, sir?
4601;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;What if he chose wrong?
4602;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
4603;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power.
4604;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;But I don't have any special powers.
4605;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.
4606;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;What is it, sir?
4607;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;"There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives."""
4608;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry.
4609;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
4610;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Albus Dumbledore;Yes.
4611;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Nearly Headless Nick;Hello, Harry.
4612;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Hey, Nick.
4613;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Nearly Headless Nick;I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and Ron are out of the hospital wing.
4614;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Oh. Thanks.
4615;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Nick, I was wondering about something?
4616;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Nearly Headless Nick;I've been expecting this...
4617;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Expecting what?
4618;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Nearly Headless Nick;A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones.
4619;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I expect so...
4620;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Nearly Headless Nick;He's not coming back, Harry.
4621;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Why?
4622;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Nearly Headless Nick;I'm sorry I couldn't be of more
4623;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Hermione Granger;Harry!
4624;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;How are you?
4625;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Ron Weasley;Good as new, mate.
4626;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Better.
4627;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Hermione Granger;Come on, let's go in to the feast.
4628;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I've got something to tell you. Something important.
4629;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;But not right now. I'm not ready.
4630;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Hermione Granger;Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are.
4631;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;Hello, Harry.
4632;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;It's the last night and I need to pack.
4633;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;Oh, people take my things and hide them.
4634;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;"I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me ""Loony"" Lovegood."
4635;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Do you need any help looking?
4636;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;Oh no. It all turns up in the end.
4637;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather.
4638;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Yeah.
4639;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;My mother. I was nine.
4640;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;I'm sorry.
4641;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again.
4642;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Harry Potter;Isn't it?
4643;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil?
4644;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;They were just out of sight, that's all.
4645;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;The Lost Prophecy;Luna Lovegood;Of course. Anyway, my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding.
4646;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;A way of coming back;Harry Potter;I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
4647;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;A way of coming back;Hermione Granger;What's that ?
4648;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;A way of coming back;Harry Potter;That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
4649;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;A way of coming back;Ron Weasley;Yeah ?
4650;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;A way of coming back;Harry Potter;Something worth fighting for
