4651;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;Narcissa!
4652;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;Cissy! You mustn't do this.  He can't be trusted.
4653;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Narcissa Malfoy;The Dark Lord trusts him.
4654;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;The Dark Lord is mistaken.
4655;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;Or so I believe.
4656;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Narcissa Malfoy;Well, who can one trust these days?
4657;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;He lives in this Muggle dunghill?
4658;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;Run along, Wormtail.
4659;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Narcissa Malfoy;I've nowhere else to turn, Severus.
4660;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;You must be joking.
4661;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Narcissa Malfoy;I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --
4662;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.
4663;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;Put it down, Bella.  We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
4664;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;You? The Dark Lord told you?
4665;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable.
4666;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;Over the years I have played my part well.  So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
4667;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
4668;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Narcissa Malfoy;I... I don't doubt you, Severus.
4669;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --
4670;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Narcissa Malfoy;He's just a boy!
4671;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection.
4672;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Narcissa Malfoy;Do you mean it, Severus?
4673;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;I can try.
4674;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Narcissa Malfoy;Oh, Severus, please, if you would... I would be forever in your debt.
4675;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;Swear to it.
4676;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;Make the Unbreakable Vow. You see.  It's just empty words. Oh he'll try.  He'll give it his best effort.  But when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole.  Bloody coward...
4677;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;Take out your wand.
4678;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes.
4679;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;I will.
4680;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?
4681;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;I will.
4682;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Bellatrix Lestrange;And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?
4683;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Snape's Visitors;Severus Snape;I will.
4684;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Who's Harry Potter?;Waitress;Harry Potter.  Who's Harry Potter?
4685;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Who's Harry Potter?;Harry Potter;Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser.
4686;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Who's Harry Potter?;Waitress;Funny that paper of yours.  Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move.
4687;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Who's Harry Potter?;Harry Potter;Really.
4688;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Who's Harry Potter?;Waitress;Thought I'd gone round the twist.
4689;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Who's Harry Potter?;Harry Potter;Hey.  I was wondering...
4690;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Who's Harry Potter?;Waitress;Eleven.  That's when I get off.
4691;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...
4692;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
4693;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm.
4694;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;I just Apparated, didn't I?
4695;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time.
4696;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;Can't imagine why...
4697;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?
4698;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir.
4699;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Wand out, Harry.
4700;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Lumos...
4701;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Horace!
4702;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Horace Slughorn;Merlin's Beard!
4703;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;There's no need to disfigure me, Albus!
4704;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
4705;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
4706;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Dragon's blood.
4707;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;Yes, well, I couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could I?  Oho!
4708;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One.
4709;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?
4710;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;S-someone else?  I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
4711;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;Oh all right!  The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  Do you know what that's like?  One can only say no to these people so many times before they...
4712;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Take matters into their own hands?
4713;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;I never stay anywhere more than a week.  The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.
4714;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?
4715;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;That was fun.  May I use the loo?
4716;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus!  The answer is still no!  Absolutely, unequivocally no!
4717;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;You look very like your father. Except for your eyes.  You've got --
4718;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;My mother's eyes, yeah.
4719;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.
4720;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year.
4721;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;Oh, but you mustn't think I'm prejudiced!  No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  Look, there she is. Right up front.
4722;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;All mine, each and every one.  Ex- students, I mean.  You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet.
4723;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;Always takes my owl should I want to register my opinion on the news of the day.  And there's Ambrosius Flume of Honeydukes.  Sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday.  That is, when I had a house.  And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time...
4724;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I taught the whole Black family except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented boy.  I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.
4725;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.
4726;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;Of course.  But you're not leaving?
4727;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind.
4728;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Horace Slughorn;All right!  I'll do it.  But I'll be wanting Professor Merrythought's old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise!  These are mad times we live in!  Mad!
4729;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Indeed they are.
4730;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;Sir, exactly what was that all --
4731;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return...
4732;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl.
4733;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;It's alright, sir.  I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --
4734;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
4735;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there's my trunk --
4736;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Albus Dumbledore;Both are waiting for you.
4737;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry Potter;Sir?
4738;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Hedwig...?  Mum!
4739;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Exactly.  How'd you guess?
4740;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;I'm joking, Mum.
4741;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Molly Weasley;You're worse than Fred and George.
4742;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here.
4743;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Molly Weasley;Harry who?
4744;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course.
4745;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Molly Weasley;I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
4746;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl.
4747;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Molly Weasley;I seriously doubt that.
4748;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Harry?  Did someone say Harry?
4749;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you?
4750;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;'Course not.  Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?
4751;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;Was that an owl I heard?
4752;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house.
4753;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;Really?
4754;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Really.
4755;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Harry!
4756;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;Harry!
4757;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Molly Weasley;But why didn't you tell us you were coming?
4758;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Didn't know. Dumbledore.
4759;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Molly Weasley;That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!
4760;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;You've a bit of...
4761;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;When'd you get here?
4762;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming.
4763;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it's too dangerous.
4764;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Oh come on...
4765;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
4766;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round.
4767;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?
4768;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.
4769;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Rubbish.  He's only -- what?
4770;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years.
4771;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Step up!  Step up!
4772;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;Step up!  Step up!
4773;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;We've got Fainting Fancy...
4774;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Nosebleed Nougats...
4775;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;And just in time for school...
4776;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Puking Pastilles!
4777;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Into the cauldron, handsome.
4778;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;Into the cauldron, handsome.
4779;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;What'd you think, Harry?
4780;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Amazing.
4781;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;Pocket that and you'll pay in more than Galleons, my friend.
4782;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;We've got eyes in the back of our heads.
4783;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;Bloody urchins.
4784;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
4785;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;A real money spinner that.
4786;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Handy if you need to make a quick escape.  Hello, ladies!
4787;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;Yes, they do really work.
4788;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.
4789;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Meaning?
4790;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
4791;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;None of your business.
4792;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;These are adorable.
4793;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Aren't they now.  Pygmy Puffs. Can't breed them fast enough.
4794;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;How much for this?
4795;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Five Galleons.
4796;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;Five Galleons.
4797;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;How much for me?
4798;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Five Galleons.
4799;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;George Weasley;Five Galleons.
4800;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;But I'm your brother!
4801;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Fred Weasley;Ten Galleons.
4802;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;C'mon. Let's go.
4803;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Lavender Brown;Hi, Ron.
4804;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Hi.
4805;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down.
4806;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
4807;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Reckon he's right...
4808;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;Oh no.  Look.
4809;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...
4810;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...
4811;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
4812;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;What're they playing at?
4813;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Dunno.  Let's get closer.
4814;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Hey.  Where's Hermione?
4815;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Harry, where is she?
4816;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;I don't know.  I'm turned around.
4817;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;Bloody hell.
4818;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;Sorry.
4819;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;What just happened?
4820;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;I don't know.
4821;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Luna Lovegood;Quibbler...?  Quibbler...?
4822;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Luna Lovegood;There's an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?
4823;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Luna Lovegood;He's lovely.  They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?
4824;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ginny Weasley;Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?
4825;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Luna Lovegood;They're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler?
4826;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Don't you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation.
4827;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --
4828;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;It's happened.  He's one of them.
4829;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;One of what?
4830;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
4831;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;You're barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
4832;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  Browsing for furniture?
4833;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Ron Weasley;It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke.
4834;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes.
4835;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Hermione Granger;I told you.  I don't know what I saw.
4836;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;What Could Be Safer?;Harry Potter;I need some air.
4837;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;What just happened?  Blaise?
4838;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Blaise Zabini;Don't know.
4839;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Pansy Parkinson;Relax, boys.  The lights went out is all.  Come, Draco.  We'll be at Hogwarts before you know it.
4840;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.
4841;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Pansy Parkinson;What's that supposed to mean?
4842;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.
4843;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;Amused, Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end.
4844;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Hermione Granger;Where's Harry?
4845;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Ron Weasley;Probably on the platform.  C'mon.
4846;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;You two go on.  I want to check something.
4847;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!
4848;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.
4849;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;Enjoy the ride back to London.
4850;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;Hello, Harry.
4851;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Harry Potter;Luna.  How'd you...?
4852;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
4853;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Harry Potter;Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna.
4854;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;It's alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.
4855;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Harry Potter;I am your friend, Luna.
4856;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;That's nice.
4857;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Filius Flitwick;About time!  I've been looking all over for you two.  Names.
4858;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Harry Potter;Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.
4859;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Filius Flitwick;No exceptions, Potter.
4860;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;Who are those people?
4861;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Filius Flitwick;Aurors. For security.
4862;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;It's a not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.
4863;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Argus Filch;And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
4864;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Severus Snape;It was his father's.
4865;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;Is my father's.  He's not dead.
4866;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Severus Snape;It's alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
4867;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Draco Malfoy;Nice face, Potter.
4868;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it's up to you.
4869;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Harry Potter;Have you ever fixed one?  A nose.
4870;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;No.  But I've done several toes and how different are they really?
4871;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Harry Potter;What the hell.  Give it a go.
4872;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;Episkey.
4873;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Harry Potter;Well?  How do I look?
4874;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Luna Lovegood;Exceptionally ordinary.
4875;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;That's For My Father;Harry Potter;Brilliant.
4876;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Ron Weasley;Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
4877;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Hermione Granger;Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!
4878;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Ron Weasley;Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic.
4879;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Ginny Weasley;He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?
4880;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Ron Weasley;Looks like his own this time.
4881;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Hermione Granger;Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?
4882;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Harry Potter;Later.  What've I missed?
4883;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Ron Weasley;Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside?
4884;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Harry Potter;Thanks...
4885;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Hermione Granger;What's happened to his hand?
4886;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Albus Dumbledore;The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn.
4887;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Albus Dumbledore;Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape.
4888;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Albus Dumbledore;Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why.
4889;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Albus Dumbledore;Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent.
4890;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Albus Dumbledore;Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you.
4891;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Albus Dumbledore;Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!
4892;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Ron Weasley;That was cheerful.
4893;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Minerva McGonagall;History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that's the girl's toilet...
4894;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Minerva McGonagall;Potter!
4895;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Harry Potter;This can't be good.
4896;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Minerva McGonagall;Enjoying ourself, are we?
4897;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Harry Potter;Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor --
4898;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Minerva McGonagall;So I noticed.  I would think you'd want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
4899;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Harry Potter;It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my
4900;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Minerva McGonagall;And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations.'
4901;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Harry Potter;Really?  Well... brilliant.  I'll head there straight away.
4902;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Minerva McGonagall;Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
4903;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Dark Forces;Ron Weasley;But I don't want to take Potions!
4904;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Harry m'boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we've brought someone with us...
4905;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Ron Weasley;Ron Weasley, sir.  But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --
4906;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Nonsense, we'll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --
4907;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Harry Potter;Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --
4908;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Not to worry.  You can get what you need from the cupboard.
4909;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Now, as I was saying, I've prepared a few concoctions this morning.  Any ideas what these might be?  Yes, Miss...?
4910;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Hermione Granger;Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.
4911;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Hermione Granger;It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --
4912;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year...
4913;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course.  That's impossible.  But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.
4914;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Katie Bell;Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one.
4915;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Ah yes...
4916;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --
4917;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Hermione Granger;Liquid luck.
4918;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately tricky to make.  Disastrous should you get it wrong.  But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off.
4919;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Katie Bell;But then why don't people drink it all the time?
4920;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence.
4921;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Blaise Zabini;Have you ever taken it, sir?
4922;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Twice.  Once when I was twenty- four.  Once when I was fifty- seven.  Two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  Two perfect days...
4923;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;So.  This is what I offer each of you today.  One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook.
4924;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  In any event -- good luck.
4925;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Hermione Granger;How did you do that?
4926;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Harry Potter;Crush it.  Don't cut it.
4927;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Hermione Granger;No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.
4928;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Harry Potter;No.  Really --
4929;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Hermione Granger;Sh!
4930;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Merlin's Beard!  But it's perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all!  Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can't you do, m'boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end...
4931;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Half Blood Prince;Horace Slughorn;Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use it well.
4932;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit.
4933;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;So.  How are you?
4934;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;Fine, sir.
4935;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.
4936;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
4937;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Do you?
4938;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;Definitely.
4939;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?
4940;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;Sir?
4941;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --
4942;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;No!  I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.  But... no.
4943;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Forgive me, Harry, I...
4944;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here.
4945;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle.
4946;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would...
4947;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Mrs. Cole;I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.  In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence.
4948;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.
4949;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Mrs. Cole;I see...
4950;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Mrs. Cole;I think I should tell you.  He's a funny boy -- Tom.  Odd.  There have been incidents with the other children.  Nasty things.
4951;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Perhaps you could give me an example.
4952;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Mrs. Cole;You've got a visitor, Tom.
4953;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;How do you do, Tom.
4954;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Mrs. Cole;Well, I'll leave you two to yourselves.
4955;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;Don't.
4956;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;As you wish.
4957;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;You're the doctor, aren't you?
4958;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;No.  I am a Professor.
4959;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;I don't believe you.  I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  They want me looked at.  They think I'm different.
4960;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Perhaps they're right.
4961;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;I'm not mad.
4962;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
4963;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;It's a school.  A school of... magic.
4964;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't.
4965;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;Yes.
4966;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.
4967;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;I can make things move -- without touching them.  I can make animals do what I want without training them.  I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  I can make them hurt... if I want.
4968;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;Who are you?
4969;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;I'm like you, Tom.  Different.
4970;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;Prove it.
4971;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It.
4972;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Take it out.
4973;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?
4974;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Why did you want these things, Tom?
4975;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;I like having things that belonged to other people.  It makes me feel ... close to them.
4976;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully.
4977;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;I can speak to snakes too.
4978;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Tom Riddle;They find me.  Whisper things.  Is that normal.  For someone like me?
4979;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;It is unusual.  But not unheard of.
4980;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;Did you know, sir?  Then?
4981;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...
4982;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?
4983;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?
4984;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything.
4985;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
4986;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;I did.
4987;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Harry Potter;Do you want me to let him?
4988;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Secret Riddle;Albus Dumbledore;Yes.
4989;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me...
4990;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ginny Weasley;Shut It!
4991;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;Thanks.  All right.  This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?
4992;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Cormac McLaggen;No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?
4993;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;Hard feelings?
4994;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Cormac McLaggen;I'll be going out for Keeper as well.  Nothing personal.
4995;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;Really?  Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --
4996;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Cormac McLaggen;I like my chances.  Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?  Wouldn't mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean?
4997;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron.
4998;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Cormac McLaggen;Hang on.  She's his sister.  How do I know she won't toss him a floater?
4999;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ginny Weasley;Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?
5000;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;Quiet!  I'm Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!
5001;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;C'mon, Ron...
5002;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Lavender Brown;Isn't he brilliant?
5003;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.
5004;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac.
5005;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;He's vile.
5006;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;Ever heard of this spell?
5007;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
5008;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;Not bloody likely.  He's top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he's a genius.
5009;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;What?
5010;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?
5011;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;No.
5012;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;Why not?
5013;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;It's... old.  The binding is fragile.
5014;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;The binding is fragile?
5015;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ginny Weasley;Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
5016;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;The who?
5017;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;The who?
5018;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ginny Weasley;That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.'
5019;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?
5020;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;I didn't say I wasn't curious. And, by the way, I don't sleep with it.
5021;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;Yeah. Right. Well, it's true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you're always reading that bloody book.  It's like being with Hermione.
5022;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;Well, I was curious.  So I went to
5023;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;The library.
5024;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Ron Weasley;The library.
5025;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;And?
5026;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Hermione Granger;And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
5027;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hermione's Helping Hand;Harry Potter;Good.  That settles it then.
5028;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Rubeus Hagrid;Hey, you three!
5029;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;What've you got there, Hagrid?
5030;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Rubeus Hagrid;Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees 'ere are drippin' with it.
5031;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?
5032;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Rubeus Hagrid;It's not fer me.  It's fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don' yeh?
5033;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?
5034;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Rubeus Hagrid;Tha's the one.  He's taken ill. I'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. Keep yer fingers crossed.
5035;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?
5036;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer.
5037;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Horace Slughorn;Filius!  I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks.
5038;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Filius Flitwick;Emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.
5039;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;Who's up for a Butterbeer?
5040;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;No.  Over here.
5041;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;No, no.  Sit next to me.
5042;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;O-kay.
5043;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Skinny kid;What'll we have?
5044;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please.
5045;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Aw, bloody hell...
5046;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands...
5047;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;And snogging.
5048;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;I'd like to leave.
5049;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;Leave?  You can't be serious.
5050;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;That happens to be my sister.
5051;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?
5052;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Horace Slughorn;Harry, m'boy!
5053;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you.
5054;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;So what brings you here, sir?
5055;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Horace Slughorn;Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back.  Longer than I'd care to admit.  In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick!
5056;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Horace Slughorn;Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!
5057;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Horace Slughorn;Listen, m'boy.  In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  Would you be game?
5058;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;I'd consider it an honor, sir.
5059;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Horace Slughorn;You'd be welcome too, Granger.
5060;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;Be delighted, sir.
5061;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Horace Slughorn;Brilliant.  Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby.
5062;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;What're you playing at?
5063;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
5064;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Get to know him?
5065;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
5066;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Um... You've got a little...
5067;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if...
5068;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Leanne;Katie.  You don't know what it could be!
5069;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;What's up?
5070;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Leanne;I warned her!  I warned her not to touch it!
5071;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --
5072;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Hermione Granger;I'll get someone --
5073;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;There's no time!
5074;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Rubeus Hagrid;Get back!  All o' yeh!
5075;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Rubeus Hagrid;Now, now.  Now, now...
5076;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Rubeus Hagrid;Don' go touchin' tha' but by the wrappin's.  Unnerstan'?
5077;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Minerva McGonagall;You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?
5078;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Leanne;It's like I said.  She went to the loo and when she came back she had the package.  She said it was important she deliver it.
5079;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Minerva McGonagall;Did she say to whom?
5080;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Minerva McGonagall;All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens?
5081;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.
5082;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Minerva McGonagall;Severus. Is this it?
5083;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Severus Snape;What do you think?
5084;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Severus Snape;I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
5085;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;She was cursed, wasn't she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly.
5086;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Minerva McGonagall;Yes.  She was cursed.
5087;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;It was Malfoy.
5088;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Minerva McGonagall;That's a very serious accusation, Potter.
5089;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Severus Snape;Indeed.  Your evidence?
5090;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;I... just... know.
5091;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Severus Snape;You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
5092;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Minerva McGonagall;I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you.
5093;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.
5094;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;What does she see in him?
5095;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Dean?  He's brilliant.
5096;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
5097;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle.
5098;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;I suppose.
5099;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;So what is it?  He sees in her?
5100;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;I don't know.  She's smart. Funny.  Attractive...
5101;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Attractive?
5102;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;You know.  She's... got nice skin.
5103;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
5104;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;Well, no.  I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.
5105;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean.
5106;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice.
5107;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Harry Potter;I think I'll be going to sleep now.
5108;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Cursed Necklace;Ron Weasley;Right.
5109;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;To Hogwarts' best and brightest!
5110;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Cormac McLaggen;Here, here!
5111;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Neville Longbottom;Which one do I use for the soup?
5112;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;So tell me, Cormac.  See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?
5113;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Cormac McLaggen;Yes, sir.  In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him and the Minister for Magic over holiday.
5114;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Well, be sure to give them both my best.  What about your uncle, Belby?  Working on anything new? For those of you who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.
5115;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Marcus Belby;Dunno.  He and me dad don't get on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish.  Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the --
5116;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;And you, Miss Granger?  What is it your family does in the Muggle world?
5117;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Hermione Granger;My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth.
5118;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Fascinating.  And is that considered a dangerous profession?
5119;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Hermione Granger;No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches.
5120;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Miss Weasley!  Come in, come in.
5121;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Ginny Weasley;Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --
5122;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;No matter.  You'll be just in time for dessert.  That is -- if Belby leaves you any.
5123;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Hermione Granger;Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean.
5124;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;What?
5125;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Hermione Granger;Nothing.
5126;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  We'll have to do it again.
5127;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Oh.  Potter.
5128;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.
5129;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Ah, yes.  A most intriguing object.  The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not...
5130;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;I think I'll be going.
5131;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Nonsense.  You have nothing to fear, m'boy.  As for some of your classmates, well, let's just say, they're unlikely to make the shelf.
5132;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;The shelf, sir?
5133;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren't you, Harry?
5134;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;I don't really know how to answer that, sir.
5135;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Your mother was modest too.  Your father not so much.  As you can see, he did not make the shelf.
5136;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
5137;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher.
5138;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts.
5139;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;What was he like?
5140;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Harry Potter;I'm sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see...
5141;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Slug Club;Horace Slughorn;Of course.  It's only natural that you should want to know more.  I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I've known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within.
5142;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Neville Longbottom;Good luck, eh, Ron?
5143;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Seamus Finnigan;Counting on you, Ron.  I've two Galleons on Gryffindor.
5144;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Ron Weasley;So.  How was it?
5145;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;How was what?
5146;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Ron Weasley;Your dinner party.
5147;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
5148;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone...
5149;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Ron Weasley;I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?
5150;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;Actually, I was going to ask you.
5151;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Ron Weasley;Really?
5152;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
5153;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Lavender Brown;Good luck today, Ron!  I know you'll be brilliant!
5154;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Ron Weasley;I'm resigning.  After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot.
5155;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Harry Potter;Have it your way.  Juice?
5156;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Ron Weasley;Sure...
5157;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Luna Lovegood;Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron.
5158;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Luna Lovegood;Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?
5159;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;Don't drink that, Ron!
5160;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;You could be expelled for that.
5161;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Harry Potter;Dunno what you're talking about.
5162;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Ron Weasley;C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win.
5163;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Ginny Weasley;What's gotten into him?
5164;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Dean Thomas;Ginny!  Let's go!
5165;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Students;Weasley!  Weasley!  Weasley!
5166;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
5167;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Harry Potter;Yep.  Apparently it's his lucky day.
5168;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;You shouldn't have done it, Harry.
5169;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Harry Potter;Yeah.  I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?
5170;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --
5171;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Felix Felicis;Hermione Granger;You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?
5172;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Hermione Granger;Charms spell.  Just practicing.
5173;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Harry Potter;Ah.  Well... they're really good.
5174;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Hermione Granger;How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her.
5175;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Lavender Brown;Oops.  I think this room's taken.
5176;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Ron Weasley;What's with the birds?
5177;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Hermione Granger;Oppugno!
5178;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Harry Potter;It feels like this.
5179;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Ron Weasley;Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent.
5180;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Hermione Granger;He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.
5181;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Harry Potter;Have you?
5182;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Hermione Granger;Yes.  Why?
5183;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Harry Potter;I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  As friends.
5184;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Hermione Granger;Why didn't I think of that?
5185;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Harry Potter;So who are you taking?
5186;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Hermione Granger;Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion.
5187;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Harry Potter;Really...?
5188;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Hermione Granger;Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?
5189;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Harry Potter;But I am the Chosen One.
5190;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;How It Feels;Harry Potter;Okay.  Kidding.  I'll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool.
5191;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Luna Lovegood;I've never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It's why I wear shoes to bed.
5192;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Horace Slughorn;Someone has taken a BITE out of it. Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of '78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of '67. Mingle, m'boy!  Mingle!  We're all friends here.  And we run the world.
5193;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Neville Longbottom;Drink?
5194;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;Neville...?
5195;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Neville Longbottom;I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club.  It's okay.  He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.
5196;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Eldred Worple;Lovegood, did you say?  I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing.  Claimed to run a magazine...
5197;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;What're you doing?
5198;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;And what's happened to you?
5199;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Hermione Granger;Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe.
5200;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;Cormac!  That's who you invited!
5201;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Hermione Granger;I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
5202;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Waiter;Dragon tartar?
5203;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Hermione Granger;No thank you.
5204;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Waiter;Just as well.  They give one horribly bad breath.
5205;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Hermione Granger;On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!
5206;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;I think she went to powder her nose.
5207;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Cormac McLaggen;Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?  Yak yak yak. What is this I'm eating, by the way?
5208;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;Dragon balls.
5209;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;What's going on back here?
5210;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.
5211;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;Not so quick, Potter.
5212;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date...
5213;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
5214;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;Besides, I only wish to convey a message.
5215;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;A message...?
5216;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes.
5217;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Harry Potter;Traveling?  Where?
5218;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Draco Malfoy;Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!
5219;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Argus Filch;Professor Slughorn, sir!  I've just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.  He claims to have been invited to your party.
5220;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Draco Malfoy;Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?
5221;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;I'll escort him out.
5222;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Draco Malfoy;Certainly... Professor.
5223;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Draco Malfoy;Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't.  What's it to you?
5224;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow --
5225;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Draco Malfoy;I don't need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won't fail him.
5226;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Severus Snape;You're afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you --
5227;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Free Agents;Draco Malfoy;No!  I was chosen.  This is my moment!
5228;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Ron Weasley;Unbreakable Vow.  You're sure that's what Snape said.
5229;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Harry Potter;Positive.  Why?
5230;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Ron Weasley;It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.
5231;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Harry Potter;I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.
5232;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Ron Weasley;No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell...
5233;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Harry Potter;Lovely.
5234;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Ron Weasley;All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
5235;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Harry Potter;I'll take your word for it.
5236;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Harry Potter;So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
5237;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Unbreakable Vow;Ron Weasley;You die.
5238;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Molly Weasley;Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come!
5239;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help.
5240;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Remus Lupin;Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
5241;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;I know it sounds mad --
5242;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Remus Lupin;Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?
5243;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;That's not what it sounded like.
5244;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Nymphadora Tonks;Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.  To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --
5245;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Remus Lupin;It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do.
5246;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --
5247;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Remus Lupin;You're blinded by hatred.
5248;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;I'm not --
5249;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Remus Lupin;You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.
5250;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ginny Weasley;Open up, you.
5251;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ginny Weasley;Don't trust me?
5252;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;It's good.
5253;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ginny Weasley;'Course 'tis.  Made them myself.
5254;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;You'll have to forgive Remus.  It takes its toll -- his condition.
5255;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?
5256;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;We're being followed, all of us. Molly doesn't leave the house most days.  It's not been easy.
5257;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;Did you get my owl?
5258;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person.  If Dumbledore's traveling, it's news to the Ministry.  But perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.  As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more.
5259;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;Go on.
5260;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes.  From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet.
5261;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;A Vanishing Cabinet?
5262;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.  But they're tricky contraptions.  Require a tremendous amount of looking after.  Eventually they fell out of favor.
5263;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?
5264;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;Nothing.  It's still there.
5265;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last.
5266;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Nymphadora Tonks;It was delicious, Molly.  Really.
5267;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Molly Weasley;You're sure you won't stay?
5268;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Nymphadora Tonks;No, we should go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst --
5269;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Molly Weasley;Remus...?
5270;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ginny Weasley;Everyone gone to bed?
5271;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;Soon.
5272;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ginny Weasley;I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?
5273;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ginny Weasley;Happy Christmas, Harry.
5274;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Nymphadora Tonks;Sweetheart...
5275;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Remus Lupin;There's someone out there.  I can smell him.  There's more than one --
5276;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ginny Weasley;Oh my god...
5277;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;Harry, no!
5278;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Nymphadora Tonks;Remus!
5279;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Arthur Weasley;Ginny, stay with your mother!
5280;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ginny Weasley;No, Harry!  It's a trap!
5281;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Fenrir Greyback;Don't you smell clean.
5282;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Hermione Granger;You have to realize who you are, Harry.
5283;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;I know who I am, Hermione, alright?
5284;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Hermione Granger;Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said.
5285;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.
5286;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Hermione Granger;What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
5287;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;You tell me.
5288;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Hermione Granger;He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill.
5289;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Harry Potter;Who could tell the difference?
5290;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Ron Weasley;Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it.
5291;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Lavender Brown;That's my Won-Won.
5292;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Death Eaters Attack;Hermione Granger;Excuse me, I have to go vomit.
5293;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Tom Riddle;Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
5294;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Horace Slughorn;Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?
5295;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Tom Riddle;Intuition.
5296;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Horace Slughorn;Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays...
5297;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Horace Slughorn;Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours...
5298;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Tom Riddle;I know a secret shortcut or two.
5299;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Horace Slughorn;Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?
5300;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Tom Riddle;Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand.
5301;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Horace Slughorn;Go on.
5302;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Tom Riddle;I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me...
5303;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Horace Slughorn;I don't know anything about such things and I wouldn't tell you if I did!  Now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again!
5304;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Albus Dumbledore;Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't.
5305;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Harry Potter;I don't understand -- what happened?
5306;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Albus Dumbledore;This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.
5307;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Harry Potter;But why would he tamper with his own memory?
5308;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Albus Dumbledore;I suspect he is ashamed of it.
5309;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Harry Potter;Why?
5310;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Albus Dumbledore;Why indeed.
5311;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Albus Dumbledore;I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so.
5312;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Albus Dumbledore;Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can.
5313;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Harry Potter;I don't know him that well, sir --
5314;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Albus Dumbledore;You're the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins.
5315;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sluggish Memory;Albus Dumbledore;This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail.
5316;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  I'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  I'm joking!  Off you go! Don't forget your rattails, Miss Alys.
5317;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Ah! If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself!  To what do I owe the pleasure?
5318;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.
5319;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!
5320;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic...
5321;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic.
5322;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?
5323;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape.
5324;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  He might... misunderstand.
5325;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;There can be no light without the dark.  And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light.  I suggest you do the same.
5326;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions.
5327;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn't he?  Didn't he!
5328;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Sir --
5329;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Hermione Granger;Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.
5330;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Nice.
5331;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Hermione Granger;You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder.
5332;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
5333;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;I've seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.
5334;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Hermione Granger;That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
5335;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;The Map is never wrong.
5336;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon.
5337;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?
5338;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one...
5339;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Or twenty.
5340;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
5341;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you.
5342;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.
5343;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Excuse me?
5344;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Well... Brilliant.
5345;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;Do you think she knows I exist?
5346;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Bloody well hope so.  She's been snogging you for three months.
5347;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;Snogging?  Who're you talking about?
5348;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Who're you talking about?
5349;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane.
5350;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Okay.  Very funny.
5351;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;What the hell was that for?
5352;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;It's no joke!  I'm in love with her!
5353;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Okay!  Fine!  You're in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!
5354;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;No.  Can you introduce me?
5355;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.
5356;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;How do I look?
5357;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Devastatingly handsome.
5358;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Damn it all!
5359;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It's you.  I'm afraid I'm busy at the moment --
5360;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
5361;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;Where's Romilda?
5362;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;What's the matter with Wenby?
5363;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in.
5364;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you.
5365;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir.
5366;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?
5367;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Hm.  Perhaps you're right.
5368;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;I'm sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding.
5369;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?
5370;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort.
5371;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;I'll ask you not to use that name.
5372;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Yes, sir.  It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible.
5373;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived.
5374;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Alright, m'boy!  Bottoms up!
5375;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;What's this?
5376;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;A tonic for the nerves.
5377;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;What happened to me?
5378;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Love potion.
5379;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;And a bloody strong one at that.
5380;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;I feel really... bad.
5381;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Pick-me-up's what you need, m'boy. Do us all good, I think.  I've got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances...
5382;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;There we are, Potter.  To life!
5383;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!
5384;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;I d-don't understand --
5385;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Professor!  Do something!!
5386;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;He's choking!!
5387;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Harry Potter;Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!
5388;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.
5389;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Albus Dumbledore;Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?
5390;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Hm?  Oh.  Yes... very proud.
5391;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Minerva McGonagall;I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.
5392;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Albus Dumbledore;Why indeed.
5393;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Albus Dumbledore;This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.
5394;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
5395;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Albus Dumbledore;To whom might I ask?
5396;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;You, Headmaster.
5397;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Lavender Brown;Where is he?  Where's my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here?
5398;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Hermione Granger;I might ask you the same.
5399;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Lavender Brown;I happen to be his girlfriend.
5400;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Hermione Granger;I happen to be his... friend.
5401;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Lavender Brown;Don't make me laugh.  You haven't spoken in weeks.  I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting.
5402;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Hermione Granger;He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.
5403;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Lavender Brown;Ha!  See? He senses my presence. I'm here, Won-Won. I'm here --
5404;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ron Weasley;Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!
5405;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Albus Dumbledore;Ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended.
5406;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Ginny Weasley;'Bout time, don't you think?
5407;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Horace Slughorn;I've always cherished my students. They're my life...
5408;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Perilous Potions;Hermione Granger;Oh shut up.
5409;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Hermione Granger;Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow.
5410;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Ron Weasley;Huh?
5411;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Ron Weasley;Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
5412;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Hermione Granger;Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --
5413;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Ron Weasley;Don't get me wrong.  I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It's just she seems... a bit put out.
5414;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Hermione Granger;Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?
5415;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Ron Weasley;Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
5416;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Hermione Granger;Right.  Boggled...
5417;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Hermione Granger;That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell.
5418;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Harry Potter;How are you, Katie?
5419;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Katie Bell;Give me a moment, girls.
5420;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Katie Bell;I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've tried to remember.  Honestly. But I just... can't...
5421;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Draco Malfoy;Cruci--
5422;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Harry Potter;Sectumsempra!
5423;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Draco Malfoy;Don't touch me!  Don't you dare touch me!
5424;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Sectumsempra;Ginny Weasley;You have to get rid of it.  Today.
5425;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Ginny Weasley;Take my hand.
5426;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Harry Potter;The Room of Requirement...
5427;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Ginny Weasley;Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.
5428;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Harry Potter;Who showed you this?  First.
5429;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Ginny Weasley;Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it...
5430;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Ginny Weasley;What was that?
5431;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Ginny Weasley;See, you never know what you'll find up here.
5432;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Ginny Weasley;All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted.
5433;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Ginny Weasley;There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...
5434;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Hiding the Book;Ginny Weasley;That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
5435;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Ron Weasley;So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
5436;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;What?
5437;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Ron Weasley;You know.  Hide the book.
5438;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Oh.  Yeah.
5439;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Ron Weasley;Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?
5440;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Say that again.
5441;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Hermione Granger;Well?  How do you feel?
5442;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Excellent.  Really excellent.
5443;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Hermione Granger;Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.
5444;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's.
5445;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Hermione Granger;What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --
5446;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?
5447;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Hermione Granger;No.
5448;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Ron Weasley;No.
5449;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Trust me.  I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does.
5450;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Merlin's beard, Harry!
5451;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Sorry, sir.  I should've announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout.
5452;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Well, yes, actually -- Why would you think that?
5453;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?
5454;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I'm familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all.  My own interests are purely academic, of course.
5455;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out.
5456;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?
5457;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going.
5458;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Harry!
5459;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Sir?
5460;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;It's nearly nightfall.  Surely you realize I can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.
5461;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Well, then by all means come along, sir.
5462;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!
5463;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;That would be counterproductive, sir.
5464;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;And what makes you say that?
5465;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;No idea.
5466;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Merlin's beard...
5467;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Is that an actual Acromantula?
5468;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;A dead one, I think, sir.
5469;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Rubeus Hagrid;'Arry.  'Orace.
5470;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;My god, dear man.  How did you ever manage to kill it?
5471;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Rubeus Hagrid;Kill 'im! Me oldest friend, 'e was!
5472;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;I'm sorry, I... didn't realize.
5473;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Rubeus Hagrid;Ah, don' worry yerself.  Yer not alone.  Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.  It's the eyes, I reckon.  Unnerve people.
5474;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Not to mention the pincers.
5475;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Rubeus Hagrid;I reckon that too... How'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?
5476;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Through the front doors.
5477;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Hagrid.  I wouldn't want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits...
5478;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Rubeus Hagrid;Don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit?
5479;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;My thoughts exactly!  Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  Old Potion Master's habit, you know...
5480;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Rubeus Hagrid;Wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.  Magnificent 'e was.  Jus' magnificent...
5481;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Why don't I say a few words?  I trust he had family?
5482;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Harry Potter;Oh yeah.
5483;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Farewell...
5484;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Rubeus Hagrid;Aragog.
5485;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Horace Slughorn;Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids.  Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home.  May your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.
5486;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Liquid Luck;Rubeus Hagrid;Tha' was... tha' was... beautiful.
5487;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;And Odo the hero, they bore him back home...
5488;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Rubeus Hagrid;To the place he'd known as a lad, They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad...
5489;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Rubeus Hagrid;I had 'im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  No bigger'n a Pekinese.
5490;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;Sweet.  I once had a fish. Francis.  Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he'd vanished.  Poof.
5491;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Rubeus Hagrid;Tha's odd.
5492;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;Isn't it?  That's life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof.
5493;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;That's never unicorn hair, Hagrid?
5494;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;Hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  Nods.
5495;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth?
5496;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Rubeus Hagrid;No idea... no idea at all...
5497;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;It was a student who gave me Francis.  One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  The petal had come from a lily.
5498;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;Your mother.  The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she...
5499;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;I know what you want.  But I can't give it to you.  It will ruin me...
5500;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Harry Potter;Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.
5501;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Harry Potter;Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
5502;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;Please don't say his --
5503;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Harry Potter;I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I'm not afraid of him.  And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep.
5504;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Harry Potter;Professor.  I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It's true.  I am the Chosen One.
5505;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Harry Potter;Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him.
5506;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Harry Potter;Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever.
5507;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;After Aragog's Burial;Horace Slughorn;Don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.  You don't know what he was like... even then.
5508;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;How is he?  Horace?
5509;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
5510;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?
5511;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Intuition.
5512;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;Good gracious, is it that time already?  Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays...
5513;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours...
5514;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;I know a secret shortcut or two.
5515;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?
5516;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other Professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand.
5517;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;Go on.
5518;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.  It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux.
5519;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;Excuse me?
5520;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Horcrux.  I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.
5521;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed.
5522;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to you.  I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you.
5523;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
5524;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Yes, I thought it might be something like that.  But I don't understand how that works, sir.
5525;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.  By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
5526;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Protected?
5527;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  In other words, you cannot die.
5528;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;How does one split his soul, sir?
5529;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom.
5530;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Murder.
5531;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same.
5532;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once?  For instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number --
5533;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;Seven!  Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?  To rip the soul into seven pieces...
5534;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Horace Slughorn;This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?  All academic...
5535;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Tom Riddle;Of course, sir.  And I promise I'll not speak of our conversation.  It'll be our little secret...
5536;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Sir --
5537;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.
5538;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?
5539;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us.
5540;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?
5541;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book...
5542;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Tom Riddle's diary --
5543;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...
5544;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;And the ring...?
5545;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Belonged to Voldemort's mother. It was difficult to find and...
5546;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
5547;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;One destroys Voldemort.
5548;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they...
5549;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;True.  But magic, especially Dark magic...
5550;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;... leaves traces.
5551;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  When you leave the school.
5552;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
5553;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Once again, I shall ask too much of you.
5554;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Hermione Granger;Harry.  It's time.
5555;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?
5556;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Hermione Granger;If one wants it to be.  Why?
5557;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
5558;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;He was going to the Room of Requirement.
5559;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Hermione Granger;Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!
5560;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Ron Weasley;No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there.
5561;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;But I'm telling you.  I saw it --
5562;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.
5563;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Hermione Granger;What if there are?
5564;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;I don't know...
5565;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Ron Weasley;Good luck, mate.
5566;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;I don't need luck.  I'll be with Dumbledore.
5567;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Severus Snape;Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
5568;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss.
5569;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Harry.  You need a shave, my friend.
5570;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man.
5571;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;You look the same to me, sir.
5572;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind.
5573;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid.
5574;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question.
5575;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Yes, sir.
5576;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide.
5577;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Should I tell you to run, you will run.
5578;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...
5579;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;You will do so.
5580;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Your word, Harry.
5581;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;My word.
5582;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Take my arm.
5583;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.
5584;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Being me has its privileges.
5585;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;It's there, isn't it?
5586;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty...
5587;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged.
5588;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Sir!
5589;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.
5590;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;You should've let me, sir.
5591;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine.
5592;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Careful.  The water.
5593;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it?
5594;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?
5595;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Accio Horcrux!
5596;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Perhaps not.
5597;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;If you would, Harry...
5598;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
5599;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one's own luck.
5600;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
5601;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Yes.
5602;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Remember... the water.
5603;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
5604;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Oh yes.
5605;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;It has to be drunk.
5606;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?
5607;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Why can't I drink it, sir?
5608;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry.
5609;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Professor?
5610;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Professor?  Can you hear me?
5611;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Don't... don't make me...
5612;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;You... you can't stop, Professor. You've got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember.
5613;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Nooooooo!!!
5614;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
5615;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;It will, sir.  It'll stop.  But only if you drink...
5616;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;My fault.  It's all my fault...
5617;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!
5618;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;What?
5619;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Your word, Harry!  Your word!
5620;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;No...
5621;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Kill me!  It's the only way!
5622;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I'll do what you say.
5623;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;I promise.
5624;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Water. Water...
5625;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Aguamenti.
5626;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;You did it, sir.  Look --
5627;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Water!
5628;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;I'm trying, sir.  I'm --
5629;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;Go...
5630;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;We have to... go.
5631;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Harry Potter;Don't worry, sir.  We're nearly there.
5632;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Horcruxes;Albus Dumbledore;I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you.
5633;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Minerva McGonagall;To your Houses.  No dawdling.
5634;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Harry Potter;We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --
5635;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...
5636;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...
5637;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Harry Potter;All right.  Okay.
5638;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Harry Potter;Sir, are you... praying?
5639;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate.
5640;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.
5641;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Do as I say, Harry.
5642;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Trust me.
5643;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?
5644;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Draco Malfoy;Who else is here?  I heard you talking.
5645;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?
5646;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;You are not an assassin, Draco.
5647;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Draco Malfoy;How do you know what I am?  I've done things that would shock you.
5648;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?
5649;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Draco Malfoy;He trusts me!  I was chosen!
5650;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Then I shall make it easy for you.
5651;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Draco Malfoy;Expelliarumus!
5652;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy.
5653;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;You're not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?
5654;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Draco Malfoy;The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
5655;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;That cabinet has been broken for years.
5656;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Draco Malfoy;I've been mending it.
5657;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.
5658;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Draco Malfoy;In Borgin & Burkes.  They form --
5659;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco.
5660;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Draco Malfoy;I don't want your help!  Don't you see!  I have to do it!  I have to! I've got to kill you or he'll kill me.
5661;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time.
5662;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Bellatrix Lestrange;Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore.  Wandless and alone.
5663;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Bellatrix Lestrange;Cornered in his own castle.  Well done, Draco.
5664;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order.
5665;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Bellatrix Lestrange;Love to, Albus.  But I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule.
5666;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Fenrir Greyback;Do it.
5667;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Bellatrix Lestrange;He doesn't have the stomach.  Like his father.  Let me finish him. In my own way.
5668;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Severus Snape;No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy's to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now!
5669;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Severus Snape;No.
5670;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Severus...
5671;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Bellatrix Lestrange;Well, look who's here.  Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Come to see the slaughter?
5672;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Albus Dumbledore;Severus... please.
5673;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Severus Snape;I gave my word.  I made a vow...
5674;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;The Astronomy Tower;Severus Snape;Avada Kedavra!
5675;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Severus Snape;You can no longer stay here.
5676;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Bellatrix Lestrange;Boo.
5677;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Bellatrix Lestrange;Draco!  Draco! They'll kill you if you stay.
5678;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Severus Snape;Go on!
5679;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Severus Snape;Go on!
5680;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Harry Potter;Cruciatus!
5681;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Harry Potter;Incacerata!
5682;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Harry Potter;Impedimenta!
5683;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Harry Potter;Fight!  Fight back, you coward!
5684;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Severus Snape;Don't ever associate that word and my name again.
5685;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Severus Snape;No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!
5686;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Harry Potter;Sectumsempra!
5687;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Severus Snape;You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?
5688;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Severus Snape;You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  Yes.  It's me.  I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
5689;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Harry Potter;Hagrid... HAGRID!
5690;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Harry Potter;Hagrid!  You alright?
5691;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Rubeus Hagrid;Take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  Not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  But if anybody can put it righ', Dumbledore can.
5692;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Harry Potter;Hagrid, Dumbledore --
5693;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Rubeus Hagrid;Only thing I can't reckon is wha' Snape was doin' with tha' lot.
5694;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;Flight of the Prince;Rubeus Hagrid;An' wha's this wi' the Dark Mar'? Who's been killed? Where's Dumbledore, 'arry? Where's Dumbledore!!
5695;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Minerva McGonagall;Potter.
5696;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Minerva McGonagall;Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone...
5697;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Minerva McGonagall;You should know... Professor Dumbledore...
5698;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Minerva McGonagall;You meant a great deal to him.
5699;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;Dumbledore.
5700;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
5701;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing...
5702;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul...
5703;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake.
5704;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;Go on.  Open it.
5705;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'
5706;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it.
5707;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
5708;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;I'm not coming back, Hermione.
5709;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;We reckoned -- Ron and me.
5710;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
5711;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick.
5712;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.
5713;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I'm around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum.
5714;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;Like that's going to happen.
5715;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;Besides, he's barking.
5716;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;Funny, he says the same about you.
5717;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive.
5718;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;You're brilliant.  You both are.
5719;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Hermione Granger;Do you think we'll ever... come back?
5720;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;R.a.B.;Harry Potter;I don’t know. I never realised how beautiful this place was.
