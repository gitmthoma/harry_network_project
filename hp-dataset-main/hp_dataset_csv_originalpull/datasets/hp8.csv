20;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""Griphook's Price"",""Harry Potter"",""The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.""";
21;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""Griphook's Price"",""Griphook"",""There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer.""";

33;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""Griphook's Price"",""Harry Potter"",""She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken.

40;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""Can you identify these, sir?""";
41;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Garrick Ollivander"",""Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.""";
42;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""And this?""";
43;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Garrick Ollivander"",""Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.""";
44;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""Was? Isn't it still?""";
45;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Garrick Ollivander"",""Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.""";
46;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Garrick Ollivander"",""The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.""";

48;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Garrick Ollivander"",""There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --""";
49;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?""";
50;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.""";
51;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Garrick Ollivander"",""He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --""";
52;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""He has found it, sir.""";
53;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now.""";
54;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Garrick Ollivander"",""He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance.""";
55;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir.""";
56;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Ron Weasley"",""You're sure it's hers?""";
57;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Hermione Granger"",""Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.""";
58;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""I reckon you should take this then.""";
59;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Ron Weasley"",""You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.""";
60;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Hermione Granger"",""But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...""";
61;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""If I can hold it, you can.""";
62;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Ron Weasley"",""How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything.""";
63;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...""";
64;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Ron Weasley"",""That's a bit scary.""";
65;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Hermione Granger"",""It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --""";
66;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""No. I just know. When one's near.""";
67;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Fleur Delacour"",""This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione.""";

73;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Bill Weasley"",""Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving.""";

85;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.""";
86;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Ron Weasley"",""You mean he could see you?""";
87;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,""He's After You"",""Harry Potter"",""Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...""";
