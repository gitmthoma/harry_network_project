16,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Doorstep Delivery,Albus Dumbledore,Good luck...Harry Potter.
22,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Vanishing Glass,Harry Potter,"Yes, Aunt Petunia."
25,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Vanishing Glass,Harry Potter,"Yes, Uncle Vernon."
72,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Letters from No One,Vernon Dursley,"Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one.  No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-"
86,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Keeper of the Keys,Rubeus Hagrid,"Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.  Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
95,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Keeper of the Keys,Rubeus Hagrid,"No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
97,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Keeper of the Keys,Rubeus Hagrid,"You're a wizard, Harry."
101,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Keeper of the Keys,Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah."
105,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Keeper of the Keys,Petunia Dursley,"Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you."
107,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Keeper of the Keys,Rubeus Hagrid,A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
121,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,"Essential bit of equipment, Harry."
122,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Harry Potter,"One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?"
125,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,"Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood."
126,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Harry Potter,"All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?"
129,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,"No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
134,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
139,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,"See, Harry, you're famous!"
140,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Harry Potter,"But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
141,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,"I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
143,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Gringotts,Harry Potter,"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
144,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Gringotts,Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
145,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Gringotts,Harry Potter,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
146,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Gringotts,Rubeus Hagrid,"They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
153,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Gringotts,Harry Potter,"What's in there, Hagrid?"
154,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Gringotts,Rubeus Hagrid,"Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
156,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Gringotts,Rubeus Hagrid,"Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
165,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Ollivanders,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry! Harry! Happy birthday!
167,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Boy Who Lived,Rubeus Hagrid,"You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
168,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Boy Who Lived,Harry Potter,"He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
169,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Boy Who Lived,Rubeus Hagrid,"First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
172,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Boy Who Lived,Harry Potter,Voldemort?
174,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Boy Who Lived,Rubeus Hagrid,"It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. ‘Cept you."
175,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Boy Who Lived,Harry Potter,Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
176,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Boy Who Lived,Rubeus Hagrid,"Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
179,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Platform 9¾,Rubeus Hagrid,"What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
180,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Platform 9¾,Harry Potter,"Platform 9¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing...is there?"
226,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Ron and Hermione,Hermione Granger,"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
230,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Welcome to Hogwarts,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello, Harry."
231,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Welcome to Hogwarts,Harry Potter,"Hey, Hagrid."
238,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Welcome to Hogwarts,Draco Malfoy,"It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
239,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Welcome to Hogwarts,Harry Potter,"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
253,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Sorting Hat,Ron Weasley,"Harry, what is it?"
258,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Sorting Hat,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter.
264,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Sorting Hat,Fred Weasley,We got Potter! We got Potter!
265,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Sorting Hat,George Weasley,We got Potter! We got Potter!
290,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Nick and Other Residents,Ron Weasley,"Look at that one, Harry!"
301,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Potions and Parcels,Minerva McGonagall,"Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time."
304,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Potions and Parcels,Severus Snape,"There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
308,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Potions and Parcels,Severus Snape,"Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter?"
309,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Potions and Parcels,Harry Potter,"Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her."
310,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Potions and Parcels,Severus Snape,"Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek."
319,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Potions and Parcels,Harry Potter,"Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
328,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Ron Weasley,"Up!!  Ooh!  Shut up, Harry."
339,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Harry Potter,Neville!
351,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Harry Potter,"Give it here, Malfoy."
352,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Draco Malfoy,"No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.  How 'bout up on the roof?  What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
353,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Hermione Granger,"Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot."
354,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Harry Potter,"Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
358,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter?  Follow me.
364,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Minerva McGonagall,"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
367,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Harry Potter,"A century, according to McGonagall."
368,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Fred Weasley,"Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
373,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Ron Weasley,"Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!"
376,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,New Seeker,Ron Weasley,"Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
434,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mountain Troll,Harry Potter,Where's Hermione?
443,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mountain Troll,Harry Potter,Hermione! She doesn't know!
446,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mountain Troll,Harry Potter,"Hermione, move!"
465,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mountain Troll,Hermione Granger,I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
473,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Quidditch,Hermione Granger,"Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
475,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Quidditch,Severus Snape,"Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin."
478,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Quidditch,Harry Potter,"Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
480,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Quidditch,Harry Potter,"The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
482,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Quidditch,Harry Potter,That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
487,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Quidditch,Ron Weasley,"Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  It's a Nimbus 2000!"
512,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Interference Overcome,Rubeus Hagrid,What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
529,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Christmas Gift,Rubeus Hagrid,Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry’s broom?
537,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Christmas Gift,Harry Potter,"But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
553,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Christmas Gift,Hermione Granger,"Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
557,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Christmas Gift,Ron Weasley,"Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
558,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Christmas Gift,Ron Weasley,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
559,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Christmas Gift,Harry Potter,"Happy Christmas, Ron.  What are you wearing?"
582,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Mirror of Erised,Harry Potter,"Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
588,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Mirror of Erised,Ron Weasley,"That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
595,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Mirror of Erised,Ron Weasley,"Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror."
596,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Mirror of Erised,Albus Dumbledore,"Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
598,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Mirror of Erised,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live."
609,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Norbert,Harry Potter,Malfoy.
633,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Norbert,Harry Potter,Hagrid!
639,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Norbert,Harry Potter,We think Snape's trying to steal it.
640,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Norbert,Rubeus Hagrid,"Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
641,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Norbert,Harry Potter,"Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
648,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Norbert,Harry Potter,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
658,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Norbert,Harry Potter,Malfoy.
660,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Norbert,Harry Potter,Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
678,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Forbidden Forest,Harry Potter,"Hagrid, what's that?"
681,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Forbidden Forest,Rubeus Hagrid,"And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy."
685,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Forbidden Forest,Harry Potter,"If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
686,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Forbidden Forest,Draco Malfoy,"Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
694,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Forbidden Forest,Harry Potter,Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
697,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Forbidden Forest,Hermione Granger,Harry!
698,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,The Forbidden Forest,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?"
701,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Up to Something,Harry Potter,But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself
705,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Up to Something,Hermione Granger,"Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched."
707,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Ron Weasley,"Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?"
714,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Harry Potter,"Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like?"
727,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Harry Potter,"That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
737,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Harry Potter,"Now, Neville, listen. We were"
748,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Harry Potter,Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.
761,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Harry Potter,Hermione!!
764,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Harry Potter,Hermione! Where are you?!
766,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Ron Weasley,Ahh! Harry!
767,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Ron Weasley,Harry!
780,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Harry Potter,"Ron, are you okay?"
784,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Harry Potter,Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
795,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Hermione Granger,"What's wrong, Harry?"
797,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Through the Trapdoor,Ron Weasley,"Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
806,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Wizard's Chess,Ron Weasley,"It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight."
811,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Sacrifice Play,Ron Weasley,"Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game."
813,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Sacrifice Play,Ron Weasley,"You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
814,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Sacrifice Play,Harry Potter,"No, Ron! No!"
818,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Sacrifice Play,Ron Weasley,"Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you.  Knight...to H-3."
821,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Sacrifice Play,Harry Potter,"RON!  NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
822,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Sacrifice Play,Hermione Granger,"You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are."
824,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Sacrifice Play,Hermione Granger,"Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
825,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Man With Two Faces,Harry Potter,"You?  No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-"
827,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Man With Two Faces,Harry Potter,"But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
829,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Man With Two Faces,Harry Potter,Snape was trying to save me?
841,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Man With Two Faces,Voldemort,"Harry Potter, we meet again."
842,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Man With Two Faces,Harry Potter,Voldemort.
846,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Magic Touch,Voldemort,"Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!"
851,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mark of Love,Albus Dumbledore,"Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
854,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mark of Love,Harry Potter,Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
862,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mark of Love,Harry Potter,"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
863,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mark of Love,Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
865,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mark of Love,Albus Dumbledore,"Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax."
866,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mark of Love,Harry Potter,"All right there, Ron?"
868,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Mark of Love,Harry Potter,All right. Hermione?
870,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,House Cup Winner,Albus Dumbledore,"Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points!  In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.  First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!"
877,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Not Really Going Home,Hermione Granger,"Come on, Harry."
880,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Not Really Going Home,Harry Potter,"Thanks, Hagrid."
881,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Not Really Going Home,Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh. Go on...on with you.  Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
882,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Not Really Going Home,Harry Potter,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
886,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,In a cage,Harry Potter,"I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon…"
887,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,In a cage,Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter!
905,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Dobby,"Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
908,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
912,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything."
916,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Stop, Dobby!"
918,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Dobby, shh!"
920,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Dobby, please stop!"
923,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
926,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Dobby,"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here…ooh… But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
931,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
934,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
943,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Dobby,Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?
945,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Dobby,"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
948,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Dobby, get back here!"
949,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Harry Potter,"Dobby, please, no!"
950,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Dobby,Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school!
952,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's warning,Dobby,"Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good."
956,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Car rescue,Harry Potter,Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
960,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Car rescue,Vernon Dursley,"Now, what the hell's he doing? Potter!"
966,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Car rescue,Ron Weasley,"Come on, Harry! Hurry up!"
969,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Car rescue,Ron Weasley,I've got you Harry!
987,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Burrow,Molly Weasley,"Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear."
989,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Burrow,Molly Weasley,"Well, you'd best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go."
1012,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Burrow,Arthur Weasley,"I mean…that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
1018,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Burrow,Arthur Weasley,"Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man."
1022,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,To Diagon Alley,Molly Weasley,"Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear."
1023,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,To Diagon Alley,Ron Weasley,"But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
1025,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,To Diagon Alley,Molly Weasley,"Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go… That's it."
1037,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,To Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry?
1038,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,To Diagon Alley,Harry Potter,Hagrid!
1040,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,To Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,"Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don' want no one ter see you there. People'll think you were up to no good."
1043,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,To Diagon Alley,Hermione Granger,Harry! Hagrid!
1049,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,To Diagon Alley,Rubeus Hagrid,"You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it, then."
1054,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Molly Weasley,"Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far…"
1059,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Gilderoy Lockhart,It can't be- Harry Potter?
1061,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,… which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving… with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
1062,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Molly Weasley,"Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron."
1063,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Draco Malfoy,"I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
1065,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Draco Malfoy,"Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend."
1066,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Lucius Malfoy,"Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter… Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
1067,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Harry Potter,Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
1091,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flying to Hogwarts,Ron Weasley,"Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!"
1094,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flying to Hogwarts,Harry Potter,"Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
1107,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flying to Hogwarts,Ron Weasley,Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!
1114,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Whomping Willow,Harry Potter,Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
1131,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Not expelled…today,Harry Potter,"See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn't want me here this year."
1137,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Not expelled…today,Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
1192,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Harry Potter,Malfoy?
1205,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Harry Potter,"No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let's take him to Hagrid's."
1212,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Harry Potter,"Malfoy. He called Hermione, …um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means."
1217,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Rubeus Hagrid,"See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call “pure blood.”"
1221,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Harry, Harry, Harry… Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
1223,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
1230,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Gilderoy Lockhart,"What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun. Heh, heh."
1233,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,Harry!
1238,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just—
1242,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
1261,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Severus Snape,"If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
1262,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Gilderoy Lockhart,"I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
1274,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
1296,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Harry Potter,"Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
1300,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Ron Weasley,"Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
1306,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Harry Potter,"A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
1314,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Rubeus Hagrid,"Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That's been tampered with, that has!"
1316,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!
1317,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Draco Malfoy,"Training for the ballet, Potter?"
1318,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Draco Malfoy,"You'll never catch me, Potter!"
1325,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
1344,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby?
1345,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
1346,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,It was you… You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
1348,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
1349,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---
1352,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,"You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
1355,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,"Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin…uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh…"
1356,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
1357,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,"This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
1360,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,"Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?"
1361,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,"Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe."
1362,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,"No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
1389,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,"An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah… Let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
1390,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Severus Snape,"Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
1391,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Good luck, Potter."
1394,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Draco Malfoy,"Scared, Potter?"
1403,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Severus Snape,"Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you."
1412,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Hermione Granger,"No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
1418,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Hermione Granger,"I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
1429,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Minerva McGonagall,"This is out of my hands, Potter."
1435,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,You're wrong.
1437,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Harry?
1439,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
1441,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Rubeus Hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!"
1444,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
1448,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you… But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
1459,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Harry Potter,"Ron, maybe I should do it?"
1473,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Ron Weasley,Uh… Harry?
1474,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Harry Potter,Ron!
1481,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Harry Potter,"Hermione, are you okay?"
1500,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Harry and Ron transformed.,Harry Potter,You're wrong!
1503,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Well? Do you?,Draco Malfoy,"Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin!"
1511,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Well? Do you?,Harry Potter,"Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!"
1514,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Well? Do you?,Harry Potter,Hermione? A- are you OK?
1538,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
1564,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Harry Potter,Hagrid! Haagriid!
1566,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
1569,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
1576,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,"W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?"
1582,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
1584,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.",Fred Weasley,"And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
1588,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.",Minerva McGonagall,"Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see."
1594,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.",Harry Potter,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
1600,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
1602,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Did you hear about Hermione?
1604,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
1630,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,You heard what Hagrid said
1632,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,"Harry, I don't like this… Harry, I don't like this at all!"
1639,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?
1641,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
1645,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,Harry.
1650,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,Harry!
1673,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
1674,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,"Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever."
1676,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,"Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
1677,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,"'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!"
1679,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,"Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin…Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. And Hermione…had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
1680,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Ron Weasley,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
1683,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,"Hermione's answered that, too."
1698,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
1720,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,"This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
1721,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Ron Weasley,"Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
1723,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah… There's no need for me to stay."
1741,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Gilderoy Lockhart,"The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"
1742,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Ron Weasley,Harry! Harry!
1743,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Harry Potter,"Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
1753,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Harry Potter,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!
1756,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,"Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
1758,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,"Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not…?"
1762,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,"She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk."
1767,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,"I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
1774,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,"Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
1780,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
1782,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
1788,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Basilisk,Tom Riddle,"Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
1790,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Basilisk,Tom Riddle,"Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very… much… alive!"
1791,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Basilisk,Harry Potter,Ginny-
1792,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Tom Riddle,"Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do… especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
1793,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Harry Potter,Ginny…
1794,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Ginny Weasley,"Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you're hurt!"
1795,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Harry Potter,"Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory."
1805,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,"And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry… first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um… second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
1806,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,"It's just… You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
1807,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,"I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
1808,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?
1811,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,"It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
1813,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,"Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
1816,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys
1818,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,"I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned!"
1831,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Albus Dumbledore,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
1832,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,"Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
1837,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
1839,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,"Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
1847,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,You shall not harm Harry Potter!
1849,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,"Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
1850,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
1869,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Welcome back,Rubeus Hagrid,"Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that aif it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o' course, I woulduh- I'd still be you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say 'Thanks.'"
1870,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Welcome back,Harry Potter,"Well, there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
1874,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Petunia Dursley,"Harry! Harry! Harry, open the door! Marge! How lovely to see..."
1875,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,"Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form."
1924,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
1941,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,": Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself."
1942,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,"As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So that's that... and no harm done."
1949,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,"Come now, Harry the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... for blowing up their aunts. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... was very, very irresponsible."
1952,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Harry Potter,"Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me?"
1955,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,"Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... wander."
1961,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Ron Weasley,Harry.
1962,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Hermione Granger,Harry.

1985,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley.
1986,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,"Harry, wonder if I might have a word?"
1992,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,"Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger."
1993,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
1994,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,"What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?"
1997,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Voldemort.
2002,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,"Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... you won't go looking for Black."
2003,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
2007,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled."
2023,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,"Thanks, Ron."
2030,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,"Harry. Harry, are you all right?"
2040,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,"No one was screaming, Harry."
2042,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Hermione Granger,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
2043,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Draco Malfoy,"Potter. Is it true you fainted? I mean, you actually fainted?"
2069,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Ron Weasley,"Oh, yeah. Um... Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it."
2085,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Harry Potter,"Shut up, Malfoy."
2092,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,"That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! I think he may let you ride him now."
2096,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,"Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak."
2097,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Ron Weasley,"That was wicked, Harry!"
2113,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Harry Potter,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
2148,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Minerva McGonagall,"Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter."
2151,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Minerva McGonagall,"I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word."
2155,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Harry Potter,I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
2160,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Remus Lupin,"The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much."
2194,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Severus Snape,What about Potter? Should he be warned?
2197,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Harry Potter,"Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?"
2198,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. Turn to page 394."
2209,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term werewolf... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were... which means man, and wolf. Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf..."
2210,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Hermione Granger,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
2222,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Hermione Granger,"Umm... no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them off."
2226,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Remus Lupin,"Listen. Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. The dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of."
2232,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Remus Lupin,"I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest."
2235,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,"Clever, Harry."
2242,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,"Now, Harry."
2251,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Harry Potter,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
2274,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,"Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:"
2292,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Hermione Granger,Harry!
2293,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Ron Weasley,"Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny."
2295,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Hermione Granger,But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
2308,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter.
2311,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Hermione Granger,Harry!
2319,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,"Well. Now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... You remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who!"
2320,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,"Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!"
2324,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,"Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters... and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black."
2326,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,"Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead."
2332,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,This: Sirius Black was... and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!
2333,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Hermione Granger,"Ron, look! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Harry, what happened?"
2335,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,"Harry. There you are. You came. Are you sure about this, Harry? You know this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level."
2339,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum.
2341,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect...
2344,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,"Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?"
2349,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!
2350,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,"Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!"
2352,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,"Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something."
2361,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Ron Weasley,"Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone."
2374,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,You tell those spiders Ron.
2385,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
2387,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
2392,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
2398,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,"Harry, are you alright?"
2399,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,"That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
2400,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,"Oh, I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night."
2404,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,"Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?"
2420,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Sirius Black,Harry Potter...
2446,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Harry Potter,Ow! Hagrid!
2450,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,"It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside the castle at this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick!"
2451,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Harry Potter,Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
2475,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?"
2476,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Harry Potter,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
2477,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Ron Weasley,"Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! Harry!"
2478,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,"Ron! Ron, wait! Harry!"
2480,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Harry Potter,Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Come on! Move!
2482,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,Harry!
2486,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Harry Potter,I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong.
2488,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Come on. Ron.
2490,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Ron Weasley,Harry it's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.
2491,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!"
2494,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Sirius Black,"Are you going to kill me, Harry?"
2508,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.
2510,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,"No, Harry it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!"
2528,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Ron Weasley,Harry! What did you just do?
2543,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,"Show me. Give it to him, Ron."
2546,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him!
2553,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,"Harry, this man..."
2574,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,"I don't know if you know, Harry... but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather."
2579,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Harry!
2582,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Harry!
2589,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Severus Snape,"There you are, Potter!"
2590,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Sirius!
2591,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Severus Snape,"Come back here, Potter!"
2592,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor's Kiss,Harry Potter,Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum!
2593,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor's Kiss,Hermione Granger,Harry?
2597,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Hermione Granger,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss."
2600,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Harry Potter,It's true. Sirius is innocent.
2608,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,What just happened? Where's Ron?
2610,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
2612,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,"Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
2617,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Hermione Granger,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year."
2626,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
2634,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,"Harry, you can't."
2636,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,"Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen."
2646,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
2689,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Yeah. Hermione?
2691,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away."
2693,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus.
2694,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,"Harry, but your dad's... Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw."
2696,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him.
2699,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry! Run!
2705,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius! Come on!
2707,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now! Right there! You'll see!
2708,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,"Harry, listen to me. No one's coming."
2709,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,"Don't worry, he will! He will come! Sirius."
2710,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,You're dying... both of you. Harry!
2711,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
2712,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,"You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... well, I had already done it. Does that make sense?"
2728,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Two Places at Once,Hermione Granger,"What's he talking about, Harry?"
2729,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Harry Potter,"I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
2730,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,"Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me."
2737,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,"Why do you look so miserable, Harry?"
2739,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,"Didn't make any difference? Harry it made all the difference in the world. You have uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief managed."
2744,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Ron Weasley,"Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it."
2753,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Hermione Granger,"How fast is it, Harry?"
2761,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Portkey,Hermione Granger,Harry!
2763,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Portkey,Harry Potter,Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?
2787,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Portkey,Arthur Weasley,Harry!
2831,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Dark Mark,Arthur Weasley,"Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?"
2838,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Dark Mark,Hermione Granger,Harry it's his mark.
2843,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Dark Mark,Arthur Weasley,"Harry, who?"
2934,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Four Champions,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter. Harry Potter?
2936,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Four Champions,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter!
2937,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Four Champions,Hermione Granger,Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
2939,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Four Champions,Albus Dumbledore,Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
2950,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Four Champions,Bartemius Crouch,"The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion."
2953,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Let Events Unfold,Minerva McGonagall,Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
2957,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Let Events Unfold,Minerva McGonagall,Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
2958,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Let Events Unfold,Albus Dumbledore,"I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?"
2965,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Let Events Unfold,Harry Potter,I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.
2966,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Let Events Unfold,Ron Weasley,"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend."
2985,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Sirius Black,Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S....
2987,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Harry Potter,Sirius?
2989,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Harry Potter,Sirius?! How...
2990,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Sirius Black,I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?
2995,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Harry Potter,No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
2998,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Sirius Black,"Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more."
3002,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Sirius Black,I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
3003,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Harry Potter,I'm not ready for this Sirius.
3006,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Sirius Conversation,Sirius Black,Keep your friends close Harry.
3013,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Hungarian Horntail,Harry Potter,Neville! You're doing it again!
3022,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Hungarian Horntail,Harry Potter,Well you can tell Ronald...
3025,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Hungarian Horntail,Harry Potter,Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
3027,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Hungarian Horntail,Harry Potter,What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
3039,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Hungarian Horntail,Rubeus Hagrid,Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.
3041,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Hungarian Horntail,Harry Potter,Ron was here?
3061,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Transforming Malfoy,Draco Malfoy,Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
3062,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Transforming Malfoy,Harry Potter,"I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic."
3078,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Transforming Malfoy,Alastor Moody,"Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths?"
3083,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The First Task,Hermione Granger,Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
3094,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The First Task,Bartemius Crouch,"Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will..."
3104,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The First Task,Hermione Granger,Your wand harry! Your wand!
3105,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The First Task,George Weasley,We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
3118,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The First Task,Harry Potter,Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
3123,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The First Task,Hermione Granger,Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
3127,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The First Task,Ron Weasley,I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
3151,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,An Unexpected Challenge,Ron Weasley,"Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?"
3188,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,An Unexpected Challenge,Ron Weasley,What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.
3198,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Yule Ball,Ron Weasley,I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
3202,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Yule Ball,Ron Weasley,"Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?"
3207,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Yule Ball,Minerva McGonagall,Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
3235,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Yule Ball,Ron Weasley,Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
3240,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Yule Ball,Voldemort,"Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!"
3242,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Hermione Granger,Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
3264,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Harry Potter,"Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?"
3266,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Hermione Granger,"Harry, tell me again."
3271,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Harry Potter,Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
3272,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Hermione Granger,"Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out."
3273,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Alastor Moody,"Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger."
3275,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Alastor Moody,Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
3276,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Alastor Moody,Why don't you help Potter put his books back.
3278,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Egg's Clue,Harry Potter,"Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great."
3280,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Second Task,Harry Potter,You're sure about this Neville.
3288,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Second Task,Harry Potter,Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?
3300,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Second Task,Albus Dumbledore,Harry!
3307,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Second Task,Hermione Granger,Harry!
3308,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Second Task,Harry Potter,Hermione
3310,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Second Task,Harry Potter,I finished last Hermione.
3313,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Second Task,Albus Dumbledore,"For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre."
3317,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Never Whole Again,Bartemius Crouch,"Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter."
3318,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Never Whole Again,Alastor Moody,Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!
3322,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Never Whole Again,Rubeus Hagrid,"Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!"
3323,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Never Whole Again,Harry Potter,Mr Crouch?
3331,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Pensieve,Cornelius Fudge,Harry! Harry how good to see you again.
3333,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Pensieve,Albus Dumbledore,"Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp."
3363,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Dreams and Suspicions,Albus Dumbledore,"Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning."
3364,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Dreams and Suspicions,Harry Potter,"Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?"
3366,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Dreams and Suspicions,Harry Potter,"It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son."
3369,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Dreams and Suspicions,Albus Dumbledore,"I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply..."
3372,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Dreams and Suspicions,Severus Snape,"Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?"
3380,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Third Task,Albus Dumbledore,and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...
3428,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Death Eaters,Voldemort,"Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!"
3429,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Death Eaters,Voldemort,"Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!"
3431,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Death Eaters,Voldemort,"Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up."
3432,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,The Death Eaters,Voldemort,"Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes."
3439,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Priori Incantatem,Albus Dumbledore,Harry! Harry!
3441,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Priori Incantatem,Harry Potter,"He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there."
3442,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Priori Incantatem,Albus Dumbledore,"It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are."
3445,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Veritaserum,Alastor Moody,Are you alright Potter?
3458,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Veritaserum,Alastor Moody,You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.
3465,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Veritaserum,Albus Dumbledore,Harry get away from there!
3468,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Veritaserum,Harry Potter,"That's Moody, but then who's...?"
3474,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Veritaserum,Albus Dumbledore,Your arm Harry.
3480,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Parting Ways,Albus Dumbledore,"I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry."
3481,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Parting Ways,Harry Potter,"Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected."
3483,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Parting Ways,Albus Dumbledore,"No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone."
3494,Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire,Parting Ways,Hermione Granger,Harry will won't you?
3516,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dudley Demented,Harry Potter,"Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back."
3519,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dudley Demented,Harry Potter,"""Expecto Patronum!'"
3520,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dudley Demented,Voldemort,"Bow to death, Harry..."
3522,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dudley Demented,Harry Potter,"""Expecto Patronum! '"
3541,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Remus Lupin,"Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here."
3543,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Remus Lupin,"We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear."
3546,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Remus Lupin,"Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks."
3547,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Remus Lupin,"Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?"
3557,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Remus Lupin,"On your broom, Harry."
3558,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Alastor Moody,Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy! The advanced guard surrounds Harry.
3560,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Alastor Moody,We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry.
3572,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Remus Lupin,"Harry, leave it to us!"
3575,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Remus Lupin,Get Harry to the safe house!
3576,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Alastor Moody,"Come on, Potter! Keep moving!"
3578,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Alastor Moody,"Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!"
3583,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Advance Guard,Alastor Moody,Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!
3584,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place",Remus Lupin,"Stay here, Harry."
3586,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place",Alastor Moody,"Right, Harry, this way."
3589,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place",Remus Lupin,"Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything."
3596,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place",Molly Weasley,"Hello, Harry dear."
3597,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place",Harry Potter,Mrs. Weasley!
3600,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place",Molly Weasley,"Harry, dear, go on upstairs-— quietly, if you please. They're all up there."
3601,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Hermione Granger,Harry!
3603,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Hermione Granger,"Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!"
3606,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Hermione Granger,"Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to."
3629,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Sirius Black,"You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort."
3631,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Molly Weasley,"And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--"
3637,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Molly Weasley,I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
3641,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Sirius Black,"What do you want to know, Harry?"
3642,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter,Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
3660,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Remus Lupin,"I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more."
3664,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Molly Weasley,"Good luck, Harry!"
3665,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Hermione Granger,"They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending"
3666,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter,"Thanks, Hermione."
3671,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Ministry of Magic,Arthur Weasley,"Well, come on, Harry. Time to go."
3674,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Ministry of Magic,Arthur Weasley,"Well, come on Harry, in we go."
3677,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Ministry of Magic,Arthur Weasley,"Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing."
3679,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Ministry of Magic,Arthur Weasley,"Keep close, Harry!"
3684,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Ministry of Magic,Arthur Weasley,"Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!"
3688,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Ministry of Magic,Arthur Weasley,"Come on, Harry!"
3690,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Ministry of Magic,Arthur Weasley,"Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely..."
3691,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Ministry of Magic,Arthur Weasley,"There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck..."
3710,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Hearing,Harry Potter,"My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away."
3736,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Arthur Weasley,"Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful!"
3741,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Lucius Malfoy,"Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter."
3743,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Lucius Malfoy,"Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours."
3747,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Arthur Weasley,"Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension."
3755,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Sirius Black,Harry!
3756,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Sirius Black,"You all right, Harry?"
3757,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Harry Potter,Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
3758,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Sirius Black,"Harry, I've got something that might interest you."
3762,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Harry Potter,"I miss them, Sirius..."
3763,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Sirius Black,"I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too."
3765,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Harry Potter,"Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?"
3766,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Originals,Sirius Black,"I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it..."
3772,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Luna Lovegood,Hermione Granger,"Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter."
3773,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Luna Lovegood,Hermione Granger,"What about you, Harry?"
3776,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"So...congratulations Ron, Hermione..."
3781,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Luna Lovegood,Luna Lovegood,"I see them too, Harry."
3784,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"Well, thanks Luna."
3785,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
3808,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Professor Umbridge's Class,Dolores Umbridge,"Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it?"
3820,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Professor Umbridge's Class,Harry Potter,What about Lord Voldemort?
3821,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Professor Umbridge's Class,Dolores Umbridge,"Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight."
3824,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Professor Umbridge's Class,Dolores Umbridge,"Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!"
3828,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Professor Umbridge's Class,Dolores Umbridge,"Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!"
3841,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Professor Umbridge's Class,Ron Weasley,"Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?"
3843,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Professor Umbridge's Class,Hermione Granger,"Good luck, Harry."
3845,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Dolores Umbridge,"Ah, Potter. Sit down."
3846,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Dolores Umbridge,"You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill."
3850,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Dolores Umbridge,"Problem, Potter?"
3852,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Hermione Granger,"Hey, Harry."
3856,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Dolores Umbridge,"That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand."
3857,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Ron Weasley,Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!
3858,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Ron Weasley,Harry--bloody hell!
3864,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Hermione Granger,"Harry, I really think you should tell--"
3868,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Harry Potter,I've asked Sirius about it.
3869,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Hermione Granger,"Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe."
3870,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Detention With Dolores,Harry Potter,"Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention."
3892,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Harry Potter,"Where are we going, Hermione?"
3896,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Harry Potter,"Hermione, what's going on?"
3900,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Harry Potter,"Hey, Neville."
3901,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Harry Potter,"Uh...same to you, Luna."
3909,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Harry Potter,"It's okay, Hermione."
3910,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Harry Potter,I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
3913,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Ginny Weasley,Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
3924,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Hermione Granger,So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?
3934,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Ginny Weasley,I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
3938,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Hermione Granger,"And did you see Cho, Harry?"
3943,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Harry Potter,"""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
3952,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Harry Potter,"What would we do without you, Hermione?"
3956,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Hermione Granger,"Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do."
3957,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Minerva McGonagall,Potter!
3961,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Minerva McGonagall,"Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry."
3965,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,In the Hog's Head,Minerva McGonagall,"Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?"
3968,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Dobby,Mr. Harry Potter!
3969,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,Dobby! What are you doing here?
3971,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,"What is it, Dobby."
3972,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Dobby,Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep.
3973,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,"Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me."
3974,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,"Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby."
3975,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.
3976,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Dobby,"Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter."
3977,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,"That's brilliant, Dobby!"
3978,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Dobby,"Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter."
3979,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,"Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays."
3982,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,"Just ignore them, Ron!"
3984,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Hermione Granger,"Harry, are you all right?"
3985,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Draco Malfoy,"Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?"
3993,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Harry Potter,Malfoy provoked us.
4004,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Dolores Umbridge,"Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter."
4008,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dumbledore's Army,Minerva McGonagall,"My hands are tied, Potter."
4017,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Hagrid's Tale,Harry Potter,"Hagrid, what happened to you?"
4021,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Hagrid's Tale,Harry Potter,"We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year."
4036,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Hagrid's Tale,Harry Potter,"Well done, Neville!"
4037,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Hagrid's Tale,Harry Potter,"Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one."
4040,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Hagrid's Tale,Harry Potter,"Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day."
4044,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Ron Weasley,Harry! HARRY!
4045,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Minerva McGonagall,Potter!
4046,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Minerva McGonagall,"Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please..."
4047,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
4048,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Minerva McGonagall,"You dreamed this, Potter?"
4050,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Minerva McGonagall,"You're sure this happened, Potter?"
4051,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Minerva McGonagall,"We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter."
4054,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Minerva McGonagall,"Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare..."
4074,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Severus Snape,"Sit, Potter."
4078,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Harry Potter,Voldemort can read minds?
4079,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Severus Snape,"As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter."
4082,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Harry Potter,"But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?"
4084,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Severus Snape,"Wand out, Potter."
4090,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Severus Snape,"Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon"
4091,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Arthur Weasley,"Come on, Harry!"
4095,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Severus Snape,"Realized what, Potter?"
4099,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Occlumency,Severus Snape,"There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you."
4114,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Unquiet Escape,Harry Potter,"Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!"
4121,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Unquiet Escape,Harry Potter,Voldemort.
4122,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Unquiet Escape,Dolores Umbridge,Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group--
4125,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Unquiet Escape,Albus Dumbledore,"In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal."
4133,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Unquiet Escape,Dolores Umbridge,But what about Potter? He was the
4145,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Unquiet Escape,Albus Dumbledore,"Quiet, Harry!"
4146,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Unquiet Escape,Cornelius Fudge,"Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry--"
4157,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Unquiet Escape,Albus Dumbledore,"It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you."
4164,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Grawp,Harry Potter,Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
4168,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Grawp,Harry Potter,"Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?"
4182,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Grawp,Rubeus Hagrid,"Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy."
4195,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Snape's Worst Memory,Severus Snape,"Have you been practicing, Potter?"
4228,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Snape's Worst Memory,Severus Snape,"Having fun, Potter?"
4235,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Snape's Worst Memory,Severus Snape,"You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!"
4245,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Harry Potter,Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!
4253,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Hermione Granger,"It just seems so unlikely, Harry!"
4254,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Harry Potter,I won't let Sirius die!
4255,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Ginny Weasley,We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
4256,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Harry Potter,Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
4257,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Hermione Granger,"Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius."
4258,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Harry Potter,"There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!"
4261,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Hermione Granger,"Yes, they can, Harry."
4275,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Hermione Granger,"Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry."
4283,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Harry Potter,Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
4285,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Out of the Fire,Harry Potter,"Kreacher, where's Sirius?"
4310,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Dolores Umbridge,"Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you."
4312,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Dolores Umbridge,I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum.
4315,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Severus Snape,"Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps from the office. Umbridge is enraged."
4316,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Dolores Umbridge,"We've played nicely, Potter. You"
4322,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Harry Potter,"Hermione, no!"
4323,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Hermione Granger,"We have to tell her, Harry..."
4325,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Dolores Umbridge,"Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?"
4329,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Dolores Umbridge,You and Mr. Potter will take me to it.
4346,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Draco Malfoy,"You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets."
4353,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Harry Potter,"Great plan, Hermione."
4363,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Fight and Flight,Hermione Granger,"There's nothing there, Harry."
4370,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Ginny Weasley,"What now, Harry?"
4375,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
4383,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,Sirius?
4384,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Hermione Granger,"There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room."
4389,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Hermione Granger,"Harry, I think we should leave."
4390,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,Sirius...yeah...
4394,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,This is it. This is where Sirius is!
4397,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Ron Weasley,"Harry, have you seen this?"
4400,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Hermione Granger,"Don't touch it, Harry!"
4404,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Lucius Malfoy,"I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter."
4405,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,Where's Sirius?
4406,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Lucius Malfoy,"We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned."
4407,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Lucius Malfoy,"The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here."
4412,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Lucius Malfoy,"Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?"
4414,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Lucius Malfoy,"Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here."
4417,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Bellatrix Lestrange,Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we torture her.
4420,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Surely you jest, Potter?"
4421,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
4424,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,"Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?"
4430,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Lucius Malfoy,"Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself."
4437,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Hermione Granger,"Harry, they went the wrong way!"
4444,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,Ron!
4450,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,Hermione!
4460,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Ron Weasley,"Hiyya, Harry."
4462,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,"We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?"
4464,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Lucius Malfoy,"Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over."
4468,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Harry Potter,"Stop, Neville!"
4472,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Department of Mysteries,Bellatrix Lestrange,"So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents."
4481,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Beyond the Veil,Sirius Black,"You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order."
4482,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Beyond the Veil,Sirius Black,"I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!"
4484,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Beyond the Veil,Lucius Malfoy,Potter!
4490,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Beyond the Veil,Remus Lupin,Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do...
4492,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Beyond the Veil,Remus Lupin,"Harry, no!"
4493,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Side by Side,Bellatrix Lestrange,"You can't stop me, Potter!"
4496,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Side by Side,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Come out, come out, Potter..."
4500,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Side by Side,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul..."
4504,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Side by Side,Harry Potter,"How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?"
4508,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Side by Side,Voldemort,"I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter!"
4519,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Wizards Duel,Albus Dumbledore,"Stay where you are, Harry!"
4520,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Wizards Duel,Albus Dumbledore,Harry!
4521,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Wizards Duel,Albus Dumbledore,"Are you all right, Harry?"
4529,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Wizards Duel,Albus Dumbledore,"I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school."
4533,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Wizards Duel,Albus Dumbledore,"I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head."
4538,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"Please sit, Harry."
4539,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"I understand how you feel, Harry--"
4541,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry."
4542,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength..."
4545,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"This pain is part of being human, Harry..."
4551,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it."
4553,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man."
4558,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
4560,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-"
4561,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year."
4562,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
4563,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed."
4565,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,"I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection."
4573,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,"Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?"
4576,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
4577,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated."
4578,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,Sirius hated him.
4589,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
4593,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy."
4601,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Harry Potter,What if he chose wrong?
4608,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Albus Dumbledore,"It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry."
4623,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Hermione Granger,Harry!
4630,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Hermione Granger,"Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are."
4631,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,Luna Lovegood,"Hello, Harry."
4648,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,A way of coming back,Harry Potter,That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
4697,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?"
4699,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"Wand out, Harry."
4708,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One."
4727,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind."
4731,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return..."
4732,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl."
4734,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry."
4742,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here.
4743,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Molly Weasley,Harry who?
4744,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,"Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course."
4745,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Molly Weasley,"I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?"
4748,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry?  Did someone say Harry?
4752,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,"Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house."
4755,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry!
4756,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Harry!
4779,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,"What'd you think, Harry?"
4815,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,"Harry, where is she?"
4827,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,"Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --"
4830,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
4834,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes."
4844,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Hermione Granger,Where's Harry?
4847,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,"Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!"
4850,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,"Hello, Harry."
4851,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Luna.  How'd you...?
4853,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,"Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna."
4855,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,"I am your friend, Luna."
4867,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,"Nice face, Potter."
4881,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Hermione Granger,"Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?"
4894,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Minerva McGonagall,Potter!
4904,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry m'boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we've brought someone with us...
4906,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,"Nonsense, we'll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --"
4907,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Harry Potter,"Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --"
4932,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,"Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit."
4943,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,"Forgive me, Harry, I..."
4983,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,"You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?"
4984,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,"No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything."
4985,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
4997,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,"All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron."
5001,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,"C'mon, Ron..."
5052,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Horace Slughorn,"Harry, m'boy!"
5071,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,"Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --"
5087,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,It was Malfoy.
5088,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Minerva McGonagall,"That's a very serious accusation, Potter."
5091,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Severus Snape,"You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One."
5127,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Oh.  Potter.
5133,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,"Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren't you, Harry?"
5136,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,"Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?"
5137,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,"You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher."
5141,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,"Of course.  It's only natural that you should want to know more.  I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I've known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within."
5147,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
5162,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ron Weasley,"C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win."
5168,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,"You shouldn't have done it, Harry."
5174,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,"How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her."
5188,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,"Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?"
5192,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Horace Slughorn,"Someone has taken a BITE out of it. Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of '78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of '67. Mingle, m'boy!  Mingle!  We're all friends here.  And we run the world."
5194,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Neville...?
5211,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,"Not so quick, Potter."
5239,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,"Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help."
5242,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Remus Lupin,"Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?"
5249,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Remus Lupin,"You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed."
5255,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,"Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?"
5265,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,"Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last."
5273,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
5277,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,"Harry, no!"
5280,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,"No, Harry!  It's a trap!"
5282,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Hermione Granger,"You have to realize who you are, Harry."
5283,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,"I know who I am, Hermione, alright?"
5285,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,"If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet."
5314,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,"You're the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins."
5315,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,"This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail."
5323,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,"I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape."
5326,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,"Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions."
5329,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Hermione Granger,"Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One."
5332,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
5335,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,The Map is never wrong.
5340,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,"I can't stop thinking about her, Harry."
5355,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,"Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane."
5359,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It's you.  I'm afraid I'm busy at the moment --
5364,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,"I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you."
5370,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,"I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort."
5382,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,"There we are, Potter.  To life!"
5383,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,"Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!"
5387,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,"Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!"
5388,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,"These girls are gonna kill me, Harry."
5389,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Albus Dumbledore,"Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?"
5391,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Minerva McGonagall,I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.
5444,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's.
5445,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Hermione Granger,"What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --"
5446,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,"No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?"
5450,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,"Merlin's beard, Harry!"
5456,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,"Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?"
5457,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,"Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going."
5458,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry!
5462,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,"Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!"
5476,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Through the front doors.
5501,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Harry Potter,Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
5505,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Harry Potter,"Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him."
5539,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us."
5542,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle's diary --
5554,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Hermione Granger,Harry.  It's time.
5555,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,"Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?"
5557,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
5569,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"Harry.  You need a shave, my friend."
5570,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man."
5574,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question."
5580,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"Your word, Harry."
5586,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty..."
5591,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine."
5597,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"If you would, Harry..."
5606,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?"
5608,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry."
5617,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!"
5619,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"Your word, Harry!  Your word!"
5632,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,"I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you."
5639,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,"No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate."
5641,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,"Do as I say, Harry."
5687,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Severus Snape,"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"
5689,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,Hagrid... HAGRID!
5690,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,Hagrid!  You alright?
5692,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,"Hagrid, Dumbledore --"
5695,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Minerva McGonagall,Potter.
5696,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Minerva McGonagall,"Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone..."
5700,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
5701,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,"No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing..."
5708,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,"I'm not coming back, Hermione."
5710,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
5711,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,"I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick."
5712,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,"You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry."
5745,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dark Lord Ascending,Severus Snape,This is a false trail.  The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.
5754,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dark Lord Ascending,Voldemort,"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  But I face an unfortunate complication.  It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins.  We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another's wand."
5783,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Harry Potter,"Absolutely not.  Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  Isn't that right, Vernon?"
5801,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Alastor Moody,"Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you."
5803,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Alastor Moody,"You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.  Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We'll go in pairs.  That way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one."
5813,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Alastor Moody,"Everyone here's of age, Potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk."
5816,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Harry Potter,"Blimey, Hermione!"
5826,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Alastor Moody,"Fancy this:  You're not you, so shut it and strip. You'll need to change too, Potter."
5829,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Hermione Granger,"Harry, your eyesight really is awful."
5831,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Alastor Moody,"Right then.  We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. As for you, Harry..."
5833,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Seven Potters,Alastor Moody,"The real Harry!  Where the devil are you, anyway?"
5839,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Aerial Ambush,Harry Potter,Hagrid!  We've got to help the others!
5845,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Aerial Ambush,Harry Potter,Hagrid... HAGRID...!
5847,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Fallen Warrior,Molly Weasley,Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?! Have you seen the others?
5857,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Fallen Warrior,Remus Lupin,What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!
5866,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Fallen Warrior,Remus Lupin,'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.'
5883,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Fallen Warrior,Remus Lupin,Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror.  He knew he'd be in the most danger.
5884,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Fallen Warrior,Arthur Weasley,It doesn't explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight.
5887,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Fallen Warrior,Harry Potter,"I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?"
5898,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Fallen Warrior,Ron Weasley,"For you?  You think Madeye died for you?  You think George took that curse for you?  You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that."
5904,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Fallen Warrior,Harry Potter,I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It's the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
5931,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dumbledore's Will,Hermione Granger,"We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --"
5945,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dumbledore's Will,Hermione Granger,To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!
5956,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Wedding,Luna Lovegood,"Hello, Harry!"
5958,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Wedding,Harry Potter,"No, 'course not.  How are you, Luna?"
5963,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Wedding,Luna Lovegood,"Come, Daddy.  Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.  He's just too nice to say so."
5997,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Wedding,Remus Lupin,Harry!  Go!  Go!
6024,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Place to Hide,Harry Potter,This one's name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
6036,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Place to Hide,Hermione Granger,"We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding..."
6037,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Place to Hide,Harry Potter,Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
6051,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Place to Hide,Hermione Granger,Harry!  Harry!
6054,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Place to Hide,Hermione Granger,"Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --"
6059,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Place to Hide,Hermione Granger,"Harry.  I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes."
6063,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Place to Hide,Harry Potter,To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...
6072,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Kreacher's Tale,Harry Potter,"Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too."
6097,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Theft of a Thief,Dobby,Harry Potter!  So long it's been --
6102,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Theft of a Thief,Dobby,"Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.  And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name, which Dobby thought was very curious.  And then Dobby saw that Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very, very --"
6141,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,"How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?"
6150,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,Ron.  You don't have a wife.
6158,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  It's us you should be worrying about.
6160,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,"I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  Deal?"
6171,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,"Ron, it's me."
6172,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Ron Weasley,"Harry!  Blimey, I forgot what you looked like.  Where's Hermione?"
6173,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --
6178,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,"Arthur!  You know you're being tracked, don't you?"
6180,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,"No, Arthur.  It's a fact.  They're watching you."
6181,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,I'll tell you later.  Let's find Hermione.
6197,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,"You're lying.  And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!"
6198,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Harry Potter,Expecto PATRONUM!
6203,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Ministry Interior,Hermione Granger,Harry... they've seen you.  We've got to get out of here.
6210,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Forest Fugitives,Hermione Granger,"Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany.'"
6214,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Forest Fugitives,Harry Potter,Hermione.  His arm --
6232,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Forest Fugitives,Harry Potter,"Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother."
6261,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Forest Fugitives,Hermione Granger,"You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It's too dangerous --"
6262,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Forest Fugitives,Harry Potter,"It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  Can you understand that?"
6274,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Forest Fugitives,Hermione Granger,"We've all made sacrifices, Harry."
6313,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Broken Ranks,Hermione Granger,"Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets."
6317,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Broken Ranks,Harry Potter,It only takes in that which makes it stronger...
6321,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Broken Ranks,Harry Potter,"You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly."
6339,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Broken Ranks,Hermione Granger,"Harry, we weren't --"
6341,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Broken Ranks,Hermione Granger,I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!
6359,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Clues Revealed,Harry Potter,"Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur's wedding."
6361,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Clues Revealed,Harry Potter,Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family.
6363,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Clues Revealed,Harry Potter,"Hermione, I've been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --"
6365,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Clues Revealed,Harry Potter,"But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?"
6366,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Clues Revealed,Hermione Granger,"It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?"
6368,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Clues Revealed,Hermione Granger,"Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?"
6369,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Clues Revealed,Harry Potter,Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open.
6370,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Clues Revealed,Harry Potter,Hermione...
6374,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Godric's Hollow,Hermione Granger,"Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve! Listen..."
6377,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Godric's Hollow,Hermione Granger,Harry.
6384,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Godric's Hollow,Harry Potter,"Happy Christmas, Hermione."
6385,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Godric's Hollow,Hermione Granger,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
6386,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Godric's Hollow,Hermione Granger,Harry...
6394,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Godric's Hollow,Hermione Granger,Omigod.  Harry...
6395,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Godric's Hollow,Harry Potter,"This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them."
6397,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,"Harry, I'm not sure about this."
6398,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Harry Potter,"Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly."
6405,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Harry Potter,"This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch's wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he?"
6411,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,Harry...
6416,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,Harry!
6418,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,"Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?"
6429,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,"Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old."
6431,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,"It was in Bathilda's sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading --"
6432,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Harry Potter,"Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?"
6436,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Harry Potter,"Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?"
6438,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Harry Potter,"Hermione, I don't need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is."
6440,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Harry Potter,"Get to the hard part, Hermione."
6447,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,"It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --"
6448,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Harry Potter,"We're young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported."
6449,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,"He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison."
6451,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Harry Potter,Hermione.  Where's my wand?
6452,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Bathilda's Secret,Hermione Granger,"It's my fault.  As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --"
6457,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Hermione Granger,"He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you."
6461,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Harry Potter,Hermione...
6467,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Harry Potter,My Patronus is a stag.
6475,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Ron Weasley,"What?  No.  Harry.  That thing's bad for me.  I can't handle it. I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
6481,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Harry Potter,"Stab it, Ron.  Now."
6484,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Harry Potter,Ron.  Don't listen to it!
6485,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Harry Potter,Ron.  Stab it!
6487,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Hermione Granger,"Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?"
6488,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Harry Potter,Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!
6491,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Harry Potter,"Do it, Ron!  Kill it!"
6498,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Harry Potter,Hermione!
6503,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Hermione Granger,"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'Hey?' Where's my wand?  Harry, where's my wand!"
6505,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sword of Gryffindor,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, you give me my wand!"
6555,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Lighting the Way Back,Hermione Granger,"Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I'm sure of it."
6557,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Lighting the Way Back,Ron Weasley,"Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time."
6561,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Three Brothers,Harry Potter,Luna.
6571,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Three Brothers,Ron Weasley,Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?
6616,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Deathly Hallows,Hermione Granger,"Why the Stone, Harry?"
6617,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Deathly Hallows,Harry Potter,"Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody."
6621,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Deathly Hallows,Ron Weasley,Not like Harry's.  I've seen a fair few.  Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry's is different.  It's perfect.
6636,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Deathly Hallows,Hermione Granger,Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!
6638,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,The Deathly Hallows,Harry Potter,They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate.
6655,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Snatchers Strike,Harry Potter,Dudely.  Vernon Dudley.
6668,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Snatchers Strike,Harry Potter,The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --
6676,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Malfoy Manor,Lucius Malfoy,"Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord... ...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?"
6687,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Malfoy Manor,Luna Lovegood,Ron? Harry?
6688,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Malfoy Manor,Harry Potter,Luna?
6696,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Malfoy Manor,Luna Lovegood,"You're bleeding, Harry. That's a curious thing to keep in your sock."
6701,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dobby has No Master,Harry Potter,Dobby? What are you doing here?
6702,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dobby has No Master,Dobby,"Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course. Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter."
6706,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dobby has No Master,Harry Potter,"Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--"
6721,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dobby has No Master,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Stop! Drop your wands. I said, drop them! Pick them up, Draco, now. Well, well, well, look what we have here. It's Harry Potter. He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord. Call him. Call him."
6726,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Dobby has No Master,Dobby,Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends.
6727,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sleeping Friend,Harry Potter,Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe.
6728,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sleeping Friend,Dobby,Harry Potter.
6729,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sleeping Friend,Harry Potter,"Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me."
6730,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Sleeping Friend,Dobby,Such a beautiful place... ...to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend... ...Harry Potter.
6750,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
6758,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
6764,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Hermione Granger,"Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?"
6789,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Hermione Granger,Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.
6791,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
6797,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Hermione Granger,"It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
6808,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,"Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --"
6809,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Luna Lovegood,"I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it."
6817,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
6828,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?"
6846,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,"Harry, what do we do? Harry...?"
6886,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Ron Weasley,"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?"
6894,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Hermione Granger,Harry! Behind you!
6919,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,"You let him in! Harry, you can't --"
6920,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,"I can't always help it, Hermione!"
6929,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose."
6932,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Harry Potter,"There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected."
6940,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
6944,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,Harry! I can see you! In here!
6983,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,"Neville, you look..."
7014,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Ginny Weasley,Harry.
7015,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,"Hey there. Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry. He frowns, speaks to Hermione."
7020,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Ginny Weasley,Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
7022,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Severus Snape,Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
7024,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle."
7025,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Severus Snape,Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.
7033,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Voldemort,Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shail leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
7049,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Ron Weasley,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux."
7056,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Harry Potter,"Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is"
7057,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Luna Lovegood,Harry! Wait! I need to talk to
7058,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Harry Potter,"I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna."
7059,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Harry Potter,"We'll talk later, Luna."
7060,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Luna Lovegood,Harry --
7069,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Harry Potter,"Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?"
7090,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Ron Weasley,Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?
7098,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,"I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me."
7113,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle --
7135,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Ginny! Neville! You alright?
7137,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Luna -- ?
7148,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Draco Malfoy,"Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry."
7152,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,What's wrong with the one you have?
7155,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
7163,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.
7171,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
7175,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,"Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul."
7181,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,"Look inside him, Harry."
7266,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
7268,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself."
7269,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
7283,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Hermione Granger,"What is it, Harry? What is it you"
7299,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Harry Potter,"I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son..."
7311,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,The Boy Who Lived,Voldemort,Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die. Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death Eaters. Harry's gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises
7313,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk."
7322,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry"
7324,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess."
7331,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust"
7332,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man."
7334,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life."
7337,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,"I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin..."
7345,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
7353,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon."
7356,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love."
7357,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,"Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?"
7361,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?"
7377,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Declare Yourself,Voldemort,"Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER Is"
7394,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Not Over,Draco Malfoy,Potter! Harry turns. Draco's hand whips forward and -- to Harry's shock -- tosses him his wand. Ron GRINS.
7414,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,The Wizard's Choice,Harry Potter,When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.
7425,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,The Wizard's Choice,Harry Potter,"When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape."
7438,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Nineteen Years Later,Harry Potter,Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
