757;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Hermione Granger"",""How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world...""";;;
758;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Ron Weasley"",""Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!""";;;
759;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Hermione Granger"",""It just seems so unlikely, Harry!""";;;
760;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Harry Potter"",""I won't let Sirius die!""";;;
761;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Ginny Weasley"",""We heard Harry yelling. What's up?""";;;
762;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Harry Potter"",""Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!""";;;

768;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Harry Potter"",""How?""";;;
769;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Hermione Granger"",""Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office.""";;;
770;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""George Weasley"",""Might be able to.""";;;
771;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Fred Weasley"",""Just give us a few seconds.""";;;

773;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Fred Weasley"",""It's been too quiet around here""";;;
774;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""George Weasley"",""Time we did some real damage to this place.""";;;
775;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Hermione Granger"",""We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.""";;;
776;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Ginny Weasley"",""We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.""";;;
777;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Hermione Granger"",""We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.""";;;
778;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Harry Potter"",""That's all we'll need.""";;;
779;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Fred Weasley"",""Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours.""";;;
780;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""George Weasley"",""Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while.""";;;

794;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Fred Weasley"",""Fairly amusing, yeah.""";;;
795;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Dolores Umbridge"",""Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.""";;;
796;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""Out of the Fire"",""Fred Weasley"",""This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!""";;;

1057;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it.""";;;
1058;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""It is my fault Sirius died tonight.""";;;
1059;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man.""";;;
1060;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""I already know all this.""";;;
1061;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?""";;;
1062;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Well, yeah, I did...""";;;
1063;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency.""";;;
1064;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""But Snape stopped giving me lessons.""";;;
1065;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed.""";;;
1066;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-""";;;
1067;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year.""";;;
1068;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...""";;;
1069;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed.""";;;
1070;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries.""";;;
1071;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection.""";;;
1072;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams.""";;;
1073;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius.""";;;
1074;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--""";;;
1075;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.""";;;
1076;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Why?""";;;
1077;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.""";;;
1078;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""What?""";;;
1079;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?""";;;
1080;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.""";;;
1081;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.""";;;
1082;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!""";;;
1083;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated.""";;;
1084;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Sirius hated him.""";;;
1085;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.""";;;
1086;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!""";;;
1087;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""I was trying to save his life!""";;;
1088;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.""";;;
1089;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.""";;;
1090;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""She never loved me.""";;;
1091;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected.""";;;
1092;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.""";;;
1093;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?""";;;
1094;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Do you remember what you asked me that night?""";;;
1095;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.""";;;
1096;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must.""";;;
1097;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""I don't understand, Professor.""";;;
1098;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Professor, why am I so important to""";;;
1099;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy.""";;;
1100;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Sir, it got smashed.""";;;
1101;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.""";;;
1102;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Sybill Trelawney"",""""""The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to""";;;
1103;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""I'm not sure I understand all that, sir...""";;;
1104;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""And...it means me?""";;;
1105;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom.""";;;
1106;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""So it's not necessarily me, sir?""";;;
1107;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""What if he chose wrong?""";;;
1108;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?""";;;
1109;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power.""";;;
1110;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""But I don't have any special powers.""";;;
1111;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.""";;;
1112;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Harry Potter"",""What is it, sir?""";;;
1113;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states """"neither can live while the other survives.""""""";;;
1114;"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,""The Lost Prophecy"",""Albus Dumbledore"",""It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry.""";;;
