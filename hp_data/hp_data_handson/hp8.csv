6733;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Shell Cottage;Luna Lovegood;It's beautiful here.
6734;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Shell Cottage;Bill Weasley;It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least.
6735;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Shell Cottage;Luna Lovegood;Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong...
6736;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Shell Cottage;Harry Potter;I need to talk to the goblin.
6737;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;How are you?
6738;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;Alive.
6739;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;You probably don't remember --
6740;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;Yes.
6741;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;And brought me here.
6742;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;You are a very unusual wizard.
6743;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;Why did you leave Gringotts?
6744;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.
6745;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Ron Weasley;Then you're on our side.
6746;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;This is a wizard's war. I take no side.
6747;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;It is impossible.
6748;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;Alone, yes. With you, no.
6749;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;How did you come by this sword?
6750;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
6751;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;It's complicated.
6752;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.
6753;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer.
6754;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;And she never suspected?
6755;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
6756;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Ron Weasley;Who put it there? The fake.
6757;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.
6758;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
6759;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;Perhaps.
6760;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;I have no interest in gold.
6761;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes
6762;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;That is my price.
6763;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Griphook;I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?
6764;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Hermione Granger;Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
6765;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him.
6766;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Ron Weasley;And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?
6767;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Griphook's Price;Harry Potter;I'm still working on that part.
6768;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Fleur Delacour;He's too weak.
6769;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;Forgive me if I don't get up.
6770;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.
6771;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;Anything, m'boy, anything.
6772;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Can you identify these, sir?
6773;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
6774;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;And this?
6775;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
6776;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Was? Isn't it still?
6777;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.
6778;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.
6779;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?
6780;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --
6781;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?
6782;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
6783;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --
6784;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;He has found it, sir.
6785;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now.
6786;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Garrick Ollivander;He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance.
6787;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir.
6788;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;You're sure it's hers?
6789;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Hermione Granger;Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.
6790;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;I reckon you should take this then.
6791;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
6792;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Hermione Granger;But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...
6793;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;If I can hold it, you can.
6794;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything.
6795;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...
6796;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;That's a bit scary.
6797;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Hermione Granger;It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --
6798;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;No. I just know. When one's near.
6799;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Fleur Delacour;This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione.
6800;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Hermione Granger;It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur.
6801;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Bill Weasley;You're leaving, aren't you.
6802;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;In the morning.
6803;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Bill Weasley;And Griphook?
6804;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;He'll be leaving too.
6805;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Bill Weasley;Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving.
6806;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Luna Lovegood;The sky has lost a star.
6807;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Luna Lovegood;My father used to say that when a child died. She looks up, smiles.
6808;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --
6809;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Luna Lovegood;I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it.
6810;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Hogwarts?
6811;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;It's not the place you left, you
6812;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Luna Lovegood;Neither am I.
6813;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;Always good value. I'll miss her.
6814;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;What d'you think?
6815;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.
6816;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;You want to tell me what that is?
6817;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.
6818;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;You mean he could see you?
6819;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...
6820;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;Go on.
6821;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Harry Potter;You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore.
6822;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He's After You;Ron Weasley;Bloody hell... that's a sight.
6823;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bellatrix Lestrange;Well, how do I look?
6824;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Hideous.
6825;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bellatrix Lestrange;Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn't I? Hold still...
6826;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --
6827;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Never mind. I'm good.  That is you in there, isn't it?
6828;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Harry Potter;You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?
6829;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Goblin;Madam Lestrange.
6830;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!
6831;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Hey. Easy.
6832;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?
6833;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Hermione Granger;He's right. I was being stupid.
6834;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Harry Potter;C'mon. Let's do it.
6835;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Goblin;Identification.
6836;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bellatrix Lestrange;I wish to enter my vault.
6837;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Goblin;I see. Very well. Excuse me, won't you?
6838;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bellatrix Lestrange;I don't like to be kept waiting.
6839;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Goblin;Next.
6840;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bellatrix Lestrange;He's with me.
6841;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;They know!
6842;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;What do you mean?
6843;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;They know she's an imposter! They've been warned!
6844;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand?
6845;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bellatrix Lestrange;And why should I do that?
6846;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Harry, what do we do? Harry...?
6847;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand, given the current climate --
6848;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bellatrix Lestrange;No, I most certainly do not understand --
6849;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;I'm afraid I must insist.
6850;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Harry Potter;Imperio.
6851;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me.
6852;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Goblin;But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault.
6853;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;I'm fully aware of that. I'm also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.
6854;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Goblin;Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --
6855;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;Let me be specific with you, Ricbert. I've run this bank for forty-five years, long before anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood!
6856;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself.
6857;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Harry Potter;How long before they come after us?
6858;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;What's that? Up ahead.
6859;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;I should have known --
6860;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Harry Potter;What is that, Griphook?
6861;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Harry Potter;Griphook! What is that!
6862;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Harry Potter;Well done. Hey.
6863;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly.
6864;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;You don't say.  Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?
6865;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;No.
6866;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;What the devil are you all doing down here!
6867;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;We need him!
6868;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you --
6869;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Imperio!
6870;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;Well done.
6871;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;No. It's not possible...
6872;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Bloody hell. That's a Welsh Green.
6873;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Hermione Granger;It looks like it's been down here forever.
6874;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;Go on.
6875;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
6876;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Hermione Granger;That's barbaric. I...
6877;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;We'll only have a few seconds. In other words... they'll be no do-
6878;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Griphook;Ready, Bogrod?
6879;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Bogrod;Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course.
6880;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Harry Potter;Lumos !
6881;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Lumos !
6882;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Hermione Granger;Lumos !
6883;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Ron Weasley;Blimey...
6884;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Hermione Granger;Look.
6885;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Gringotts;Hermione Granger;No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
6886;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Ron Weasley;Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?
6887;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Hermione Granger;It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY.
6888;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Hermione Granger;Ron, your foot!
6889;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Griphook;We'll be crushed! Hurry!
6890;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Harry Potter;That's it. Up there.
6891;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Hermione Granger;How're we going to reach it?
6892;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Harry Potter;Give me the sword! The real one.
6893;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Ron Weasley;Keep going!
6894;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Hermione Granger;Harry! Behind you!
6895;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Ron Weasley;The cup!
6896;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Hermione Granger;In here!
6897;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Harry Potter;We have a deal, Griphook.
6898;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Griphook;I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.
6899;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Harry Potter;Griphook! Griphook!
6900;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Copping the Cup;Griphook;Thieves! Help! Thieves!
6901;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;Foul little git. Least we've got Bogrod.
6902;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;That's unfortunate.
6903;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;We can't just stand here! Who's got an idea?
6904;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;You're asking us? You're the brilliant one.
6905;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;I've got something. But it's mad.
6906;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;Relashio!
6907;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;That's your idea?
6908;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Harry Potter;Come on!
6909;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;It doesn't realize it's free!
6910;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!
6911;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;Bloody hell.
6912;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Harry Potter;We're dropping!
6913;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;I say we jump!
6914;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;When?
6915;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Voldemort;The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe.
6916;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Harry Potter;He knows.
6917;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;How is it you --
6918;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Harry Potter;I saw him.
6919;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;You let him in! Harry, you can't --
6920;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Harry Potter;I can't always help it, Hermione!
6921;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;Never mind! What did you see?
6922;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Harry Potter;He's angry. But he's scared too. He's going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.
6923;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;What happens when he finds out four are gone?
6924;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Harry Potter;I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts.
6925;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;What?
6926;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;What?
6927;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;You saw it?
6928;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Hermione Granger;Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --
6929;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Harry Potter;Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose.
6930;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Exit the Dragon;Ron Weasley;'Fraid he's right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We can't just walk in the front door.
6931;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Harry Potter;We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.
6932;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Harry Potter;There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected.
6933;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Ron Weasley;Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.
6934;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Harry Potter;No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more
6935;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Hermione Granger;They were ready for us.
6936;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Death Eater;We know you're here, Potter. There's no getting away.
6937;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Death Eater;Perhaps you need some convincing.
6938;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Ron Weasley;What's he mean by that?
6939;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Hermione Granger;No, you'll give us away.
6940;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Final Hiding Place;Harry Potter;Expecto Patronum!
6941;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;In here, Potter.
6942;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Ron Weasley;Did you get a look at him! Fora second I thought it was --
6943;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Hermione Granger;I know.
6944;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Hermione Granger;Harry! I can see you! In here!
6945;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is --
6946;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;You're Aberforth.
6947;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;Dumbledore's brother. It's you I've been seeing -- here. It's
6948;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;Where've you left him?
6949;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;He's dead.
6950;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.
6951;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago.
6952;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --
6953;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you'd be if I didn't.
6954;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;Right then. Reckon you're hungry. Let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here.
6955;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Hermione Granger;Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
6956;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;The Order is finished. You-Know- Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
6957;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
6958;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;Did he now? Nice job? Easy?
6959;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.
6960;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight.
6961;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;It's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor boy. Go home. Live a little longer.
6962;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through.
6963;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;Why should he...
6964;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;Keep secrets? You tell me.
6965;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.
6966;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;Did you now? And why is that?
6967;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;I had no reason not to —-
6968;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who won't even tell him where to start. You're lying. Not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does.
6969;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;You're drunk.
6970;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;You don't strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I'll ask you again. There must be a reason. Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why?
6971;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;You know what to do...
6972;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Harry Potter;Where've you sent her?
6973;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;You'll see soon enough.
6974;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Hermione Granger;That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful.
6975;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;She'll always be beautiful.
6976;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Hermione Granger;She died very young, didn't she.
6977;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Aberforth Dumbledore;My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her. She was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time.
6978;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Hermione Granger;Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.
6979;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Hermione Granger;Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?
6980;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Hermione Granger;She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!
6981;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Aberforth Dumbledore;Ron Weasley;Who's that with her? Bloody hell...
6982;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;I knew you'd come! I told them alii! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!
6983;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Harry Potter;Neville, you look...
6984;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron!
6985;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way.
6986;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Well? Ready?
6987;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Ron Weasley;I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.
6988;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors.
6989;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Hermione Granger;How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster.
6990;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Hardly ever see him. It's the Carrows you have to watch out for.
6991;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Harry Potter;The Carrows?
6992;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the Carrows.
6993;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Hermione Granger;They did that to you? But why?
6994;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Today's Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed.
6995;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there.
6996;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?  Hey! Listen up, you lot! I've brought you a surprise!
6997;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Seamus Finnigan;Blimey.
6998;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.
6999;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Nigel Wolpert;River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report: Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck...
7000;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;Okay, okay! Stand down! lLet's not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance!
7001;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Harry Potter;Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who.
7002;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;What is it?
7003;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Harry Potter;We don't know.
7004;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Dean Thomas;Where is it?
7005;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Harry Potter;I realize it's not much to go on.
7006;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Seamus Finnigan;That's nothing to go on.
7007;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Harry Potter;I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?
7008;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Luna Lovegood;Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.
7009;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Luna Lovegood;The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous.
7010;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Cho Chang;Yes, but Luna, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it.
7011;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Ron Weasley;Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
7012;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Cho Chang;It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara.
7013;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Cho Chang;Ravenclaw's was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer.
7014;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Ginny Weasley;Harry.
7015;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Harry Potter;Hey there. Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry. He frowns, speaks to Hermione.
7016;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Ron Weasley;Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother.
7017;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Seamus Finnigan;Got loads of those, though, doesn't she? There's only one Harry.
7018;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Ron Weasley;Shut up, Seamus.
7019;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Neville Longbottom;What is it, Ginny?
7020;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Ginny Weasley;Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
7021;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Hogwarts Reunion;Alecto Carrow;Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn't want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you?
7022;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Severus Snape;Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
7023;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Severus Snape;I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
7024;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Severus Snape;For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle.
7025;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Severus Snape;Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.
7026;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Harry Potter;I think I can help you out with that... -.. Harry appears.
7027;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Harry Potter;And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.
7028;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Harry Potter;How dare you stand where he stood.
7029;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Harry Potter;Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!
7030;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Harry Potter;I'm a Gryffindor.
7031;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Voldemort;I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is foily.
7032;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Voldemort;I wish you no harm. TI have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit...
7033;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Voldemort;Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shail leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
7034;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Pansy parkinson;But he's there! Potter's there! Someone grab him!
7035;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Argus Filch;Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
7036;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Argus Filch;Oh. Sorry, mum.
7037;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Give Me Harry Potter;Argus Filch;Right away.
7038;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Harry Potter;Time. As much as you can give me.
7039;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Harry Potter;Is that possible, Professor?
7040;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Harry Potter;I think you're right.
7041;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Harry Potter;You, too, Professor.
7042;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Neville Longbottom;Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?
7043;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Neville Longbottom;To blow it up. Boom.
7044;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Neville Longbottom;Wicked.
7045;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Seamus Finnigan;I can bring 'er down.
7046;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Filius Flitwick;You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.
7047;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Pomona Sprout;That doesn't mean we can't hold him up.
7048;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Professors;Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum...
7049;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Ron Weasley;Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux.
7050;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Hermione Granger;Unless we can destroy it.
7051;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Ron Weasley;So we were thinking --
7052;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Hermione Granger;You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.
7053;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Ron Weasley;You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?
7054;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Harry Potter;Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
7055;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Duty To Our School;Hermione Granger;Where are you going?
7056;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Harry Potter;Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is
7057;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Luna Lovegood;Harry! Wait! I need to talk to
7058;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Harry Potter;I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna.
7059;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Harry Potter;We'll talk later, Luna.
7060;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Luna Lovegood;Harry --
7061;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Harry Potter;Later.
7062;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Luna Lovegood;Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: 'There's not a person alive who's seen it.'
7063;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Luna Lovegood;It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead.
7064;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;You Need Only Ask;Luna Lovegood;He's very impressive, isn't he?
7065;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Voldemort;They never learn. Such a pity.
7066;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Voldemort;Begin.
7067;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Pius Thicknesse;But, my Lord, shouldn't we wait --
7068;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Fred Weasley;Nice night for it!
7069;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Harry Potter;Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?
7070;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Seamus Finnigan;That's it. I want a charge on each and every joist.
7071;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Neville Longbottom;You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?
7072;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Neville Longbottom;Blimey.
7073;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Neville Longbottom;Not good.
7074;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Luna Lovegood;If you're to find her, you'll find her down there.
7075;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Luna Lovegood;No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy.
7076;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Kingsley Shacklebolt;Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
7077;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Dean Thomas;Yes, sir.
7078;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Kingsley Shacklebolt;Dean!
7079;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Remus Lupin;It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers.
7080;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Kingsley Shacklebolt;Who said that?
7081;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Remus Lupin;Me.
7082;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Remus Lupin;Speaking of quality.
7083;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Remus Lupin;You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you.
7084;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Nymphadora Tonks;He'll sleep 'til dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight.
7085;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Harry Potter;It's you...
7086;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Neville Longbottom;Ha! dal
7087;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Neville Longbottom;Yeah! You and whose army!
7088;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Seamus Finnigan;Woah! Easy up there!
7089;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Neville Longbottom;Sorry.
7090;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Ron Weasley;Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?
7091;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Hermione Granger;No. Of course not.
7092;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Ron Weasley;I've never got this far before.
7093;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Hermione Granger;I'm scared.
7094;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Ron Weasley;Me too. Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this.
7095;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Blow For Blow;Hermione Granger;Not this.
7096;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.
7097;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;I do not answer to that name.
7098;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me.
7099;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;Are you a friend of Luna's?
7100;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
7101;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;You seek my mother's diadem.
7102;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;Yes! That's right --
7103;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you.
7104;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;Wait! Please!
7105;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;Many have sought my mother's diadem. Its powers are
7106;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --
7107;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me!
7108;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;I want to destroy it.
7109;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed.
7110;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;But I only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the pain I felt... the pain I feel even now...
7111;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory —-
7112;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name...
7113;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;Tom Riddle --
7114;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;But he lied.
7115;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;He's lied to many people --
7116;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic!
7117;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;Strange... you remind me of him a bit...
7118;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;It's here. In the castle. In the
7119;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Helena Ravenclaw;If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask...
7120;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;Thank you... -.. then turning...
7121;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Finding the Diadem;Harry Potter;Thank you... -.. then running.
7122;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;You do it.
7123;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Yes, you can.
7124;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Neville Longbottom;Not good.
7125;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ginny Weasley;Ready!?
7126;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Neville Longbottom;Are you bloody joking?!
7127;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Seamus Finnigan;He's good...
7128;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Seamus Finnigan;He's good...
7129;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ginny Weasley;What?
7130;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Neville Longbottom;That was kind of exciting. Seamus grins and winks knowingly. Ginny shakes her head.
7131;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ginny Weasley;Mad. The both of you.
7132;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Neville Longbottom;Not good.
7133;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Argus Filch;Night-tee night.
7134;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Pansy parkinson;You let us out of here, you filthy squib!
7135;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Ginny! Neville! You alright?
7136;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Neville Longbottom;Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?
7137;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Luna -- ?
7138;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Neville Longbottom;I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!
7139;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ginny Weasley;I know.
7140;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Bloody hell. We/'ll never find him on this.
7141;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Hermione Granger;There he is.
7142;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Brilliant.
7143;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Hermione Granger;He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:
7144;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Hermione Granger;That's right. I did.
7145;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Let's go.
7146;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Hermione Granger;Brilliant.
7147;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Draco Malfoy;Take my hand.
7148;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Draco Malfoy;Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry.
7149;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;I could ask you the same.
7150;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Draco Malfoy;I virtually lived here last year. Remember?
7151;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;I remember.
7152;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;What's wrong with the one you have?
7153;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Draco Malfoy;Easy.
7154;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Why didn't you tell her?
7155;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
7156;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Draco Malfoy;Give me my wand.
7157;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;No. I don't think so...
7158;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me...
7159;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Gregory Goyle;C'mon, Draco. Don't be a prat.
7160;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Gregory Goyle;Avada Kedavra!
7161;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Expelliarmus!
7162;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Hermione Granger;Did you see where it went? The diadem!
7163;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.
7164;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;RUN! Goyle's set the bioody place on fire!
7165;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Split up!
7166;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Hermione Granger;Do we climb!
7167;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;No, it''ll just follow us!
7168;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Here! Take one!
7169;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Serves him right.
7170;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Hermione Granger;C'mon! This way!
7171;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
7172;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Brilliant.
7173;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Voldemort;Nagini. Come.
7174;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;You're bloody well welcome!
7175;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul.
7176;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;He does.
7177;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;It's the snake. She's the last one. The last Horcrux.
7178;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Where will he take her?
7179;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Hermione Granger;Someplace safe.
7180;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Harry Potter;No. He'll keep her close.
7181;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Look inside him, Harry.
7182;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Fiendfyre;Ron Weasley;Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this.
7183;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten.
7184;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Lucius Malfoy;Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?
7185;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!
7186;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Lucius Malfoy;Of c-course, my Lord.
7187;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;How do you live with yourself, Lucius?  Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately.
7188;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Harry Potter;I know where he is.
7189;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Sybill Trelawney;There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.
7190;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Luna Lovegood;Thanks.
7191;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Neville Longbottom;Don't mention it.
7192;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;Why doesn't it work for me?
7193;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Severus Snape;You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --
7194;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!
7195;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Severus Snape;There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only.
7196;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;Does it?
7197;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Severus Snape;My Lord?
7198;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;The wand. Does it truly answer to me?
7199;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know.
7200;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?
7201;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Severus Snape;With you, of course, my Lord.
7202;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am
7203;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.
7204;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Severus Snape;My Lord --
7205;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus.
7206;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;But only I can live forever...
7207;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;Kill.
7208;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;He Will Come To Me;Voldemort;Nagini! Come!
7209;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Take them...
7210;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Take them!
7211;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Please.
7212;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Harry Potter;Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
7213;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;They are the same...
7214;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;You have your mother's eyes...
7215;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Ron Weasley;He's gone. The snake too.
7216;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Voldemort;You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical bliood
7217;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Voldemort;I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.
7218;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Ron Weasley;Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!
7219;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Hermione Granger;Where is everyone?
7220;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Lily... Then...
7221;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Petunia Dursley;Lily! Come out of there! Now!
7222;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Petunia Dursley;We're going home.
7223;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special.
7224;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Lily Potter;That's mean.
7225;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;It's true. You know so yourself.
7226;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;No! Don't kill me!
7227;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;That wasn't my intention.
7228;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?
7229;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Is this about the Prophecy?
7230;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Yes.
7231;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;How much did you relay?
7232;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her.
7233;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --
7234;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Yes! But he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!
7235;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy.
7236;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;I have asked.
7237;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
7238;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;She's more than that! She's different! Beautiful. Kind.
7239;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?
7240;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Anything.
7241;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;You said you would keep her safe!
7242;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus.
7243;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;The boy survives.
7244;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;He has her eyes.
7245;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;He doesn't need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --
7246;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.
7247;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;No one can know. Your word.
7248;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist.
7249;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father's. And he seems to relish his fame.
7250;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging.
7251;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;You see what you want to see.
7252;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Perhaps. oOh. Severus.
7253;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.
7254;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;I was... foolish... greedy...
7255;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.
7256;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;For the time being?
7257;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;It will spread.
7258;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;How long?
7259;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Maybe a year.
7260;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Well, this makes matters much more straightforward.
7261;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?
7262;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;It is not expected that he will succeed.
7263;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;You must agree.
7264;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.
7265;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;You ask too much.
7266;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
7267;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Tell him what?
7268;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself.
7269;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
7270;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;So when the time comes, the boy must die.
7271;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
7272;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?
7273;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Expecto Patronum!
7274;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;Lily. After all this time?
7275;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Severus Snape;Always... We GO TO BLACK...
7276;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Your Mother's Eyes;Albus Dumbledore;The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...
7277;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Hermione Granger;Where've you been?
7278;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Ron Weasley;We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --
7279;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Harry Potter;I'm going there now.
7280;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Ron Weasley;Are you mad! No!
7281;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Harry Potter;It's... meant to be.
7282;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Ron Weasley;Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him -- Hermione squeezes Ron's arm, silencing him.
7283;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Hermione Granger;What is it, Harry? What is it you
7284;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Harry Potter;There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
7285;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Harry Potter;I think I've known for awhile.
7286;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Hermione Granger;I'll go with you. I/'ll --
7287;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Harry Potter;Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over.
7288;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Oliver Wood;I'll take him from here.
7289;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Ginny Weasley;It's all right. We're going to get you inside.
7290;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Student;I kept calling. No one came.
7291;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Confront Your Fate;Ginny Weasley;Don't worry. I won't leave you. I promise.
7292;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Lily Potter;You've been so brave, sweetheart.
7293;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Harry Potter;Why are you here? All of you?
7294;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Lily Potter;We never left, dear.
7295;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Harry Potter;Does it hurt? Dying?
7296;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Sirius Black;Quicker than falling asleep.
7297;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Remus Lupin;And he will want it to be quick.
7298;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;James Potter;You're nearly there, son.
7299;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Harry Potter;I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son...
7300;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Remus Lupin;Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand...
7301;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Harry Potter;You'll stay with me?
7302;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;James Potter;Until the end.
7303;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Harry Potter;He won't be able to see you?
7304;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Sirius Black;No. We're here, you see.
7305;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Harry Potter;Stay close to me.
7306;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;I Open At the Close;Lily Potter;Always...
7307;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Boy Who Lived;Corban Yaxley;No sign of him, my Lord.
7308;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Boy Who Lived;Voldemort;I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken.
7309;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Boy Who Lived;Harry Potter;You weren't.
7310;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Boy Who Lived;Corban Yaxley;Quiet!
7311;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Boy Who Lived;Voldemort;Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die. Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death Eaters. Harry's gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises
7312;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;You cannot help.
7313;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.
7314;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?
7315;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Oh, yes.
7316;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Then... I'm dead too?
7317;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Not?
7318;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Not.
7319;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.
7320;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?
7321;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
7322;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry
7323;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
7324;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess.
7325;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Professor, is that -- ?
7326;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Exactly where are we, sir?
7327;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?
7328;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
7329;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party.
7330;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?
7331;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust
7332;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man.
7333;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Sir --
7334;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life.
7335;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?
7336;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Yes.
7337;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin...
7338;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?
7339;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;I've got to go back, haven't I?
7340;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;That is up to you.
7341;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;I've got a choice?
7342;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train.
7343;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;And where would it take me?
7344;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;On.
7345;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
7346;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;True.
7347;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;And the snake lives.
7348;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Yes.
7349;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;And I've nothing to kill it with.
7350;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;'Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'
7351;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my
7352;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle.
7353;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon.
7354;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Which would be, sir?
7355;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Luck.
7356;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love.
7357;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?
7358;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Actually, if I think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all.
7359;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Professor.
7360;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Harry Potter;Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?
7361;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Albus Dumbledore;Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?
7362;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Bellatrix Lestrange;My lord, let me help you --
7363;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Voldemort;I do not require assistance.
7364;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Bellatrix Lestrange;The boy. Is he dead?
7365;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Narcissa Malfoy;Is he alive? Draco?
7366;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Sorting Hat;Don't despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good reason...
7367;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Ginny Weasley;Who's that?
7368;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Ginny Weasley;... Hagrid's carrying?
7369;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Ginny Weasley;Neville, who is that?
7370;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Arthur Weasley;What's going on here, Neville?
7371;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;King's Cross;Voldemort;Behold, Nagini. Our work is done.
7372;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Ginny Weasley;No... NO!
7373;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Voldemort;Stupid girl. You cry for that?
7374;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Voldemort;While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's.
7375;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Voldemort;So do not cry for that. He's not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat.
7376;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Ron Weasley;Liar!
7377;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Voldemort;Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER Is
7378;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Voldemort;Now is the time to declare yourself.
7379;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Lucius Malfoy;Draco...
7380;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Lucius Malfoy;Draco, don't be stupid --
7381;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Narcissa Malfoy;Come, Draco.
7382;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Ron Weasley;He saved your life.
7383;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Declare Yourself;Voldemort;Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don't be shy.
7384;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Well, I must say, I'd hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?
7385;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Who might you be, young man?
7386;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Neville Longbottom;Neville Longbottom.
7387;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Well, welcome, Neville. I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.
7388;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Bellatrix Lestrange;Someone has to do the washing.
7389;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Now, now, Bellatrix. Let's not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day...
7390;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Neville Longbottom;I'd like to say something.
7391;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Very well, Neville. I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.
7392;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Neville Longbottom;It doesn't matter that Harry is gone. A troubled MURMUR ripples through the crowd.
7393;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Neville Longbottom;This isn't over.
7394;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Draco Malfoy;Potter! Harry turns. Draco's hand whips forward and -- to Harry's shock -- tosses him his wand. Ron GRINS.
7395;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Ron Weasley;Well done, Malfoy!
7396;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Harry Potter;Confringo!
7397;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Harry Potter;The snake! We've got to kill the snake!
7398;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Neville Longbottom;Harry! Look out!
7399;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Nagini! With me!
7400;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Leave her!
7401;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;I said LEAVE HER!
7402;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Nagini
7403;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Die! Die
7404;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Not Over;Voldemort;Why do you live!
7405;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wand's Choice;Harry Potter;Because I have something worth living for.
7406;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wand's Choice;Harry Potter;Confringo!
7407;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wand's Choice;Bellatrix Lestrange;Come on, granny, give us your best.
7408;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wand's Choice;Molly Weasley;Back off, boys! She's mine!  You will never touch my chiidren again!
7409;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wand's Choice;Bellatrix Lestrange;Be thankful we only took one. Besides...
7410;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wand's Choice;Ron Weasley;Hermione!
7411;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wand's Choice;Hermione Granger;Yes!
7412;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wand's Choice;Hermione Granger;I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it!
7413;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Harry Potter;You were right.
7414;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Harry Potter;When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.
7415;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Voldemort;It belongs to me! I killed Snape!
7416;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Harry Potter;Together.
7417;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Hermione Granger;What's the matter with her?
7418;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Sybill Trelawney;There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.
7419;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Harry Potter;I told you: it's useless to you.
7420;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Ron Weasley;Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?
7421;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Hermione Granger;Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
7422;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Hermione Granger;Something my mum used to say.
7423;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Hermione Granger;Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand.
7424;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Harry Potter;Because it answers to another.
7425;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Harry Potter;When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape.
7426;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Ron Weasley;But that means...
7427;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Harry Potter;It answers to me.
7428;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Ron Weasley;What do you reckon we should do with it?
7429;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Hermione Granger;We?
7430;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;The Wizard's Choice;Harry Potter;Well, it wasn't boring, was it?
7431;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Harry Potter;Together?
7432;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Hermione Granger;Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.
7433;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Albus Potter;Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?
7434;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Harry Potter;There's nothing scary about thestrals. They're gentle things. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages. You/'be going in the boats, remember?
7435;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Albus Potter;Dad?
7436;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Harry Potter;Yes?
7437;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Albus Potter;What if I'm put in Slytherin?
7438;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Harry Potter;Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
7439;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Albus Potter;But just say I am --
7440;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Harry Potter;Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
7441;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Albus Potter;Really?
7442;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Harry Potter;Really.
7443;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Harry Potter;Ready?
7444;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2;Nineteen Years Later;Albus Potter;Ready.
